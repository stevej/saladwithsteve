My dad played his first golf tournament last weekend and scored 4th place. Way to go, Dad! That PGA Pro Tour game I got him along with the Game Boy Advance must've really made a difference.

    I've been working on a beginner's guide to E programming. I'll post the URL late tonight after I make some hefty revisions and merge dnm's notes into the fray.
    <P>
    Gratiutious Bullet Point List Relating to my Hobby Coding Plans:
    <UL>
    <LI>Finish E paper
    <LI>Get MNet working on OpenBSD 3.0, contact Python port maintainer about rolling in changes.
    <LI>Clean up Momoko parser, check it into CVS.
    </UL>
    I'm still not really sure how this parser will fit into the general Momoko mindshare so it's best if I just take what I have, check it into cvs, let Brandon ponder it, tell me his ideas for how to fit it in. I figure it will be an iterative process looking like this:
    <ul>
    <li> fit parser into one Interpreter
    <li> see if how I envision it being handed Strings to parse is consistent with how Brandon feels that Strings should be handed to it.
    <LI> our seperate visions battle it out Thunderdome-style. (I guess Hume-style if you want to get all philosophical 'n shizzat)
    <LI> fit parser into now unified vision.
    <LI> fit into next Interpreter
    <LI> rinse, lather, repeat.
    </ul>

    Stacy and I had a lot of fun at Ev's party last night. I finally met <a href="http://shellen.com/">jason</a> in person and this other guy made me laugh so hard that I nearly (or mostly) cried. 
    <P>
    We only stayed about 3.5 hours due to BART but this should be the last time that I ever have to worry about missing the train back to the East Bay again. Soon I'll be back in My City. She <a href="http://kode-fu.com/shame/codecon/stagette.html">made out</a> with Joey in my absence. Bitch.
