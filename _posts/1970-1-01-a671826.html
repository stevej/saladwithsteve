As some of you have guessed, I've Switched Back to Linux. Between <a href="http://icommune.net/">iCommune</a> being put to sleep, Apple's <a href="http://news.com.com/2100-1023-955805.html">use of the DMCA to kill products they don't like</a>, and my huge questions regarding their licensing of Cocoa, I decided that it was no longer prudent for me to continue running OS X. I've already migrated most of my data over to another machine and in a few weeks to a few months I'll put my TiBook/667 and possibly my g4/400 tower on the market if I decide not to run LinuxPPC on it.

    It seems to me that <a href="http://www.redhat.com/software/linux/personal/index.html">RedHat 8</a> + <a href="http://www.linuxgazette.com/issue43/nielsen.xdm.html">xdm</a> + <a href="http://vhost.dulug.duke.edu/~louie/screenshots/csm-desktop.png">Gnome 2</a> is just as nice as OS X. Maybe that's because the only apps I care about are Emacs/Mozilla/gcc/bash. iTunes is easily (and thankfully) swapped out for <a href="http://xmms.org/screenshots.html">xmms</a>, Apple Mail is only slightly better than <a href="http://www.ximian.com/products/evolution/features.html">Ximian Evolution</a>, and <a href="http://www.redhat.com/docs/manuals/RHNetwork/ref-guide/intro.html">Redhat Network</a> works as well for me as Apple Software Update ever did. It upgraded my kernel and system libraries without a hitch. Redhat found all my hardware (wifi card, built-in sound, video card, usb camera, etc), configured it correctly and had me up and running at my nonstandard resolution (1400x1050) in no time at all. They've done a Great Job.

    This doesn't mean I'm going to start an anti-OS X crusade. I'm an Engineer not a Preacher, I only care about building stuff and while Apple's tech does help people build stuff, their legal department tears stuff down. I'm still really excited to hear about people's interesting OS X projects. I'm also going to continue developing in Objective-C whenever possible. I liked it before I had even heard of Cocoa, there's no reason to like it less now.
