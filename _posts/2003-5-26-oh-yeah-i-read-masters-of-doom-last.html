Oh yeah, I read <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0375505245/qid=1053936723/sr=8-1/ref=sr_8_1/104-7906092-9299903?v=glance&s=books&n=507846">Masters of Doom</a> last week as well. I thought it was a pretty decent book albeit an amazingly quick page turner.

    I don't think I could have worked at id. Even though I'd switch career paths to work with John Carmack, that place sounded like a disaster during Quake 3; full of bickering, hurt feelings, and crazy public squabbles with former coworkers.
