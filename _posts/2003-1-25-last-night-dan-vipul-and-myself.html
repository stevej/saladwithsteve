Last night <a href="http://pobox.com/~dnm/">Dan</a>, <a href="http://vipul.net/">Vipul</a>, and <a href="http://saladwithsteve.com" title="uhh.. where'd you think I'd link?">myself</a> discovered just how good the margeritas are at <a href="http://bayarea.citysearch.com/profile/907656/">Tommy's Mexican Restaurant</a> on Geary and 23rd Ave. Good Booze = No Hangover. Tommy's is a little loud but I think they have the best fajitas in town.
