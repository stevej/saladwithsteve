    <blockquote>
    <i>The COPs (Copyright Owner Plaintiffs) in the ReplayTV case have asked the judge to have the EFF's lawyers barred from seeing a stunning 78% of the documents in the case. The justification? That the EFF is a "competitor" of the studios and shouldn't be allowed to see their trade secrets.</i><small>[via LawMeme]</small></blockquote>

    BTW, I'm an EFF <a href="http://www.eff.org/perl/join">member</a> now. I'm ready to strike fear into the hearts of ne'er-do-wells!
