title: Where is Steve?

I am painfully late getting my travel photos online. Here's my most recent journey: to the balcony off our bedroom.

    A nice, albeit hazy sunset tonight. Hey, it only took us a year to finally get furniture for the balcony. Only 2 more pieces of furniture, a paint job, and a new coat of stain for the deck and I think we'll have a party. Holy crap, who's ready to party? I am. Want proof? Greg Stein would be proud!

    These are the two boxes of booze my two friends and I took to a cabin near Heppner, Oregon for Memorial Day weekend. Yes, it seems like overkill. 'seems' is the wrong verb. Holy Lord...

    On this particularly bad night, we started drinking around midnight and "finished" around dawn. I woke up to the sounds of a bear attacking the cabin and realized it was just rosco still dry heaving 6 hours later. Happy birthday, buddy!
