Kevin Burton has been talking about interfactories lately, basically a factory method that can return a class conforming to an interface based on properties found in a ResourceBundle. I've been doing something very similiar with Blogger and it's incredibly useful. But you know, this was never possible before Reflection. Reflection effectively made java a static-dynamic hybridly-typed language. And since many of the supposed benefits of a static type system go right out the door when using reflection, why not just throw away the rest of the bulky, frustrating static type system and just use a dynamically-typed Java instead. You know, Objective-C.;-)

    Well, there are good reasons to use Java, it has a fuller class library than ObjC (for now), you know the size of int never changes, and you never have to deal with a core dump in Java but core dumps really aren't a big deal once you've gotten used to them. It seems to me that prototyping systems in Python and implementing them in ObjC might be the next wave. I'm preparing for the static-type backlash. Except among C hackers, who can't be convinced otherwise. Rabid dogs. But hey, even they use void* pointers and pointers to functions.
