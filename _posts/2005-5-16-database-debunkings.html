    Man, I love it when computer scientists get catty. I originally thought this guy might be a huckster using incredibly contrary views to try and beef up his credibility (which works with a surprisingly large number of people) but I think he makes some great points and also offers solutions. I think the attitude is just his way of trying to break past the inertia of these ideas. Hey, it worked on me, I just ordered his book "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0201485559/ref=sib_rdr_dp/103-8788523-0647823">Practical Issues in Database Management: A Reference for the Thinking Practitioner</a>" from Amazon. It has a forward by C. J. Date, a name which holds some serious weight in the DBMS community.
