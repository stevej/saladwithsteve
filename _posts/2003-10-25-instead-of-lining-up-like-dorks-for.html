Instead of lining up like dorks for the Panther release, Stacy and I travelled many blocks through Berkeley to see the Slackers. They played two long sets! That's 3 hours of Slack. I don't know how they did it, they're warriors. Apparently this is their schtick for the tour.

    I gotta say, my least favorite part of any Slackers show are the spazzy white kids trying to dance while I'm trying to enjoy the music. Even the superior rhythms of this great band could not salvage these pathetic attempts at dancing. They really should just give up. I have.
