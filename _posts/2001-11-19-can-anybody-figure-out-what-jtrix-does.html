Can anybody figure out what <A href="http://www.jtrix.com">JTrix</a> does?
    <P>
    From the website: "Jtrix is an open source platform for developing applications which smoothly evolve and adapt". Elsewhere: "Jtrix is a reliable, uniformly dynamic, virtual general purpose computing platform which aggregates administratively heterogenous resources from many sources on the Internet". What the?!
    <P>
    Reading further, they desperatly want to be a universal platform for mobile code. My thoughts on the subject are that I don't want a universal platform. What I want are standards and deep interop. They don't seem interested in that.
