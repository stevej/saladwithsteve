    I really hope people don't actually follow <a href="http://evhead.com/2005/11/ten-rules-for-web-startups.asp">Ev's "Ten Rules for Web Startups"</a>. It's much easier to compete against companies who are too scatterbrained to really focus and put out a decent product!

    I didn't know that Ev actually followed GTD but I remember that he went to the David Allen seminar we had at Google back in 2003.
