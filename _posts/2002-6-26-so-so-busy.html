I am so incredibly busy these days. But we're kicking ass.
    <br /><br />
    Here's a few links for you degenerates:
    <ul>
    <li>Excellent <a href="http://www.shiro.dreamhost.com/scheme/docs/jlugm2000.html">piece</a> on how everybody's favorite functional language and a homegrown OODBMS
    saved Square USA</li>
    <li>I read <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0887309895/qid=1025117644/sr=1-1/ref=sr_1_1/102-8488606-2718516">Dealers of Lightning</a> recently. Wonderful narrative about the early days of Xerox PARC.</li>
    <li>Speaking of amazon, I put the url to my wishlist online in the sidebar. Please, feel free to spend the 210$ on The Handbook of Process Algebra. If you don't, the potential consequence will be very grave indeed.</li>
    </ul>
    
    Also, I've been bit with the <a href="http://www.omnigroup.com/applications/omnioutliner/">OmniOutliner</a> bug. I do have a feature request: Export to HTML.

    Last note: Oracle, you sick sadistic bastards. Why must you try and reshape in the world in your own, retarded image? Tell Larry to go back to his garden.
