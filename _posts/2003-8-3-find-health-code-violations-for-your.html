Find <a href="http://www.dph.sf.ca.us/ehs/Viol_DB/Index_viol.asp">health code violations</a> for your favorite SF restaurants! I think somebody should make a game based on this site.  You get more points if you eat at places with more past violations. To start, we're going to go have lunch at <a title="not for the faint of heart"  href="http://www.dph.sf.ca.us/ehs/Viol_DB/fac_Allviolations.asp?FACILITY_I=FA0246623">Giorgio's</a>. 6 points!
