I recently picked up a used copy of <a href="http://hci.stanford.edu/%7Ewinograd/shrdlu/">'Understanding Natural Language'</a> from a Santa Cruz bookstore via Amazon. There's a name inscribed by the previous owner: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_A._Huffman">David A. Huffman</a>. I find that remarkable.
