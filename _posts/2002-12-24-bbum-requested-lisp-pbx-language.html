BBum <a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0100490/2002/12/23.html#a363">requested</a> a Lisp PBX language specification so I whipped up one for Scheme but as I don't have the December Dev tools and refuse to download them over this 33.6 dialup connection, I can't actually test my new specs. Plus, AFAIK, PBX doesn't do parenthesis matching yet so I doubt anybody would actually use it to hack around in Scheme. Hmm, I wonder if I can get <a href="http://plt-scheme.org/">PLT Scheme</a> to emit a list of it's keywords the same way Python will.
