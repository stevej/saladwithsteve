My first Chinese New Year is arriving. I am incredibly excited. Before any of you ask, and I'm sure you're all very curious, the answer is "No, I'm not a toddler". It's just my first one. Really, I'm not a toddler. Please don't be confused.

    Now stop and think; If Steve were under the age of 1 would he have a blog? Or a job? Or a fine collection of alcohol and junk mail? Would he be able to speak of himself in the third person? No, not unless he was a really spectacular pre-1 year old.
