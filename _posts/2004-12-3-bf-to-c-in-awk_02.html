title: "BF to C in awk"
---
I wrote a <a href="http://www.muppetlabs.com/~breadbox/bf/">Brainfuck</a> to C translator in awk. It only takes a few minutes and I noticed that no awk version of this <a href="http://esoteric.sange.fi/brainfuck/impl/compilers/">existed.</a>
    <br /><br />
    I haven't run it through it's paces (I just wrote a few small brainfuck programs to test it out) so if you find a bug, please let me know.

    <strong>update:</strong> You can blame this on Evan Martin, <a href="http://www.livejournal.com/users/evan_tech/85802.html">his recent post</a> wherein half the universe decided to weigh in about PHP had a mention of <a href="http://modbf.sourceforge.net/">mod_bf</a>. Am I easily distracted or what?

    <strong>update:</strong> Last update, I swear. <a href="http://accesscom.com/~darius/">Darius</a> said that I don't need to initialize  <tt>b</tt> if I declare it <tt>static</tt>. Also, I realized that my previous version wouldn't understand if you had multiple operators on the same line since it was matching records and not fields. This version works on all of the programs I tried in the Brainfuck archive (as long as you strip comments).
