is not impressing me sofar. It's missing lots of the probes that come standard with Solaris 10 such as:

    <tt>
    <ul>
    <li>sched</li>
    </ul>
    </tt>

    io     
    fbt     
    proc     
    mds39     
    dtrace     
    vminfo     
    profile     
    syscall     
    PROVIDER     
    lockstat     
    mach_trap
