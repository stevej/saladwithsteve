title: Still can't run a legal radio station
---
I plugged <a href="http://nelson.monkey.org/~nelson/weblog/">Nelson</a>'s ICBM coordinates into the <a href="http://www.fcc.gov/mb/audio/lpfm/lpfm_channel_finder.html">Low Power Radio FM Channel Finder, </a>a handy way to determine if there's enough space for you to run a low power FM transmitter (legally, as opposed to how I used to do it) and found that <a href="http://www.fcc.gov/fcc-bin/lpfm_channel_finder?dlat=37&amp;mlat=44&amp;slat=1&amp;dlon=122&amp;mlon=27&amp;slon=22&amp;detail=1">there's no room at all.</a> Bummer.
