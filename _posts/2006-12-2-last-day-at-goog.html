title: "Last Day at The Goog."

<p>
    Friday was my last day at Google. After 5.2 years on Blogger, I thought it was time to pack it in. I am looking forward to some major time off to tool around the house, see friends, hack on some open source projects, and make a major dent in my reading list.

    I have a bunch of ideas for small things I'd like to prototype, too. And besides those maths you use daily as an engineer, I've gotten kinda rusty. I don't think I could integrate to save my life right now! Thank god that's not usually required in your typical life saving endeavor.

    Oh! More blogging! And more silly pictures like in the <a href="http://buzz.blogger.com/2006/12/so-long-and-thanks-for-all-blogger.html">Blogger Buzz</a> post. Thanks for that, guys. :-) If I ever run for president, the press will know where to go to discredit me in the red states. <em>"How can you vote for him? He's in a little box!" "Yeah, yeah, in a little box..."</em>

    I only had a small idea of how large blogging would become back in 2001 when I joined Ev at Pyra. By small, I mostly mean "ridiculously wrong". I'm grateful that he gave me the chance to tear apart his baby and I will miss all the brilliant people I had the chance to work with. Seriously, who will fix my bugs now?
