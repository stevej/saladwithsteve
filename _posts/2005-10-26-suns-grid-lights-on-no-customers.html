title: Sun's grid: lights on, no customers
---
From <a href="http://www.theregister.com/2005/10/25/sun_grid_slip/">The Register</a>: "Many of you will remember the fanfare and bravado surrounding Sun Microsystems' Sep. 2004 announcement of a $1 per hour per processor utility computing plan. What you won't remember is Sun revealing a single customer using the service. That's because it hasn't."
