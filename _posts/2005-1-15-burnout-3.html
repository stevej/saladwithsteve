    I really like racing games but not if they're simulations. I think Chris Crawford summed up why when <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0131460994/qid=1105782663/sr=8-1/ref=sr_8_xs_ap_i1_xgl14/103-9566998-2504646?v=glance&s=books&amp;n=507846">he wrote</a>: "Good games do not simulate physical reality; they mirror emotional reality."
