title: Putting my money where my mouth is

<p>
    I've been going on and on about <a href="http://scala-lang.org/">Scala</a> and <a href="http://liftweb.net/"><em>lift</em></a> these past few months to pretty much anybody who would listen. <em>Lift</em>, an alpha web framework for the object-functional language Scala, takes advantage of Scala's numerous features to provide a surprisingly powerful web framework in less than 10k lines of code. Take a look at the <a href="http://liftweb.net/">lift</a> site to get an idea of what it can do. <small>(Hint: David wrote a wiki in 45 lines of code)</small>

    I can see it doing for Scala was Rails did for Ruby.

    So when <a href="http://blog.circleshare.com/">David</a> asked me if I wanted to be a committer, I jumped at the opportunity. I have a couple of patches going in my local SVN working copy mostly related to proper serving of MIME types and caching that I hope to get in soon.
