Jay Allen (author of MT-Blacklist) <a href="http://www.jayallen.org/comment_spam/2004/05/mtb_20_and_ip_banning#comment-7670">weighs in</a> on  the arms race with spammers:
    <blockquote>
    If you use a captcha, spammers will use OCR. If you make them answer a question, they'll collect all of the questions and answer them one by one, or even better, post the question on their own porn sites as a "bot protection" question on their <strong>own</strong> sites, hence programmatically getting an answer from another human.
    </blockquote>
    That last part should have you scared. He's right, CAPTCHA is completely vulnerable to man in the middle. Another good reason to dump CAPTCHA and find something better.
