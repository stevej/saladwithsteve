    "Of course if you don't even try to make software that other people use, it can't be very shitty. The people who make the most noise are people who don't show us their software, they don't stick their necks out. That's why their opinion about how software is made isn't very interesting! Show us your software that doesn't suck and I will bow down and worship at your altar."

    yes, it's also true of people who claim to be able to critique software engineers when they themselves don't put out code. They know who they are. Actually, they probably don't. Frightening.
