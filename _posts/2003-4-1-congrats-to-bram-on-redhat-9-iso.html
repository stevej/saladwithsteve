Congrats to <a href="http://advogato.org/person/Bram">Bram</a> on the redhat 9 iso distribution. It seems to be going really well, just like he keeps saying it would. Here are some <a href="http://f.scarywater.net/graphs.html">fun graphs</a> showing BitTorrent network traffic.  Speaking of Bram, I was reading his advogato blog when I ran across the following: "An architecture is a set of libraries which are so poorly encapsulated that if you want to use one of them you have to use all of them." I really have nothing to add or detract, I just thought it was a good quote that would probably get too little airtime.

    I discovered today that Chandler <a href="http://blogs.osafoundation.org/mitch/000139.html#000139">is going to be demo'd</a> at <a href="http://conferences.oreillynet.com/etcon/">ETCON</a>. I'm finally starting to get excited by Chandler. Now, if only I could mirror their wiki so I could read the documentation on the train.
