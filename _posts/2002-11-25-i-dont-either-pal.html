title: I don't either, pal.
---
The other week at a restaurant I was washing my hands before dinner when two 12-year old buddies were running around the bathroom, and one of them ran into a stall and yelled at his pal to come over and look what he had found. The other kids ran over, stopped, looked for a while, and finally said "I don't like looking at poop" as if it was a thought he'd never had before. Ah, self discovery.
