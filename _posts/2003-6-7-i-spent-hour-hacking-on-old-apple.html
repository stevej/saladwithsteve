I spent an hour hacking on the old Apple ][ emulator <a title="the finest Apple][ emu that money can't buy" href="http://quark.netfront.net:6502/">YAE</a> to get it to build under Redhat 9 <small>(notice the Last-Modified date given at the bottom of that page is from 1997)</small> only to spend the next 10 seconds realizing that the game I was itching to play, <a href="http://c64.users2.50megs.com/montezuma.htm">Montezuma's Revenge</a>, wasn't fun anymore. I'd never seen it in color, though.
