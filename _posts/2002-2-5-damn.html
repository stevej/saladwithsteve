Damn. I don't like the New New Economy. i've dubbed it "Dude, Where's My Job?". While I happen to still be in gainful employ, my housemates are not
    and they exercised their rights to sell. I have 30 days to find a new place to live. Or chain myself to the front door. Chains chafe my delicate skin so I'll just move.
    <P>
    I'm interested in moving to the richmond district or the inner sunset. Someplace close to my [affectionate pet nickname], close to public transit to
    {work|friends}, and close proximity to wonderful asian-cooked (non-sea) beasties. And coconut milk soup.
    <P>
    Hoo Ah, San Francisco! Prepare for my karate blow to the privates!
