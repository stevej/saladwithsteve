Sweet. With Project Builder, Interface Builder, and Mulle's xml-rpc Objective-C library, I was able to build a pretty functional, not to mention attractive, UI to wrap around the objective-c blogger client I wrote yesterday afternoon. <br /> <br /> It only took me about 3 hours for both the UI and the non-UI together. That wasn't so bad besides a few API snags.
