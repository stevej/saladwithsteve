Want to work on Blogger? We just <a href="http://www.google.com/jobs/eng/ui.html#ui_blogger">posted a UI position</a> on Google's job page.
    <br /><br />
    CW <a href="http://massless.org/?archive=2004/08/want-to-work-on-google-ui-its-hiring">posted about it the other day.</a> Unfortunately, according to his post, you'll have to work with me (even though I'm not a UI engineer). Drop me a mail if you're qualified and interested.
