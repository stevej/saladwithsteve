title: Disk vs. RAM. Round 1.

    <blockquote> I think more and more scalable compute infrastructures
    are going to cheat and ditch disk (or memory buffered disk) in favor
    of all in-memory data structures or SSD.  </blockquote>

    <p>Putting all of your data in memory is <strong>not</strong> cheating, it's just
    another trade off.</p>

    <p>This is not a direct rebuttal to Kevin, it's just generic advice to
    the random engineer who might run across this. To any managers out
    there: I'm oversimplifying some issues. Your engineers will know
    which. </p>

    <p> Let's look at what Hennessy Patterson (4th Ed)
    tells us about memory access times. I've ranked them fastest to
    slowest.

    <ol>
    <li>Register: 250ps</li>
    <li>L1 Cache: 1ns</li>
    <li>RAM: 100ns</li>
    <li>Disk 10ms</li>
    </ol>

    </p>

    <p>We used to think of memory hierarchy layers being about an order of
    magnitude slower than the preceeding layer but that hasn't been true
    for some time. A disk access at 10ms is 1000 times slower than reading
    from RAM. If you really care about user request latency then you don't want
    to be hitting disk per-request if you can afford not to.</p>

    <p>So are you comfortable adding several hundred milliseconds for a
    request? You might be if you're a seriously resource constrained
    startup and have a very large amount of data like your typical IR
    system such as Kevin's does.  If you have a relatively small amount of
    data then keeping everything in RAM is a pretty amazing trade-off.</p>

    <p>As a medium-sized startup, what if you could pay 30 grand and see that
    money have an <strong>immediate</strong> impact on those pesky,
    painful performance graphs you keep. Wouldn't you spend that?</p>

    <p>But it's easy to think about those dollars and tell yourself:
    "well, disks also store bytes, why not stick our bytes in those
    instead and use this money to pay for an off-site to get away from our
    performance troubles?" I'm kidding, people don't actually say that out loud but
    I've seen some eyes bug out of some sockets when looking at RAM
    prices. It's just natural to want to use disk for on-line storage
    since disks store so much data and seems so much cheaper if you don't
    think about the latency difference.</p>

    <p>But let's talk concretely. I've been talking about "small" and
    "large" amounts of data. Let's talk about a specific scenario.</p>

    <p>You have a popular restaurant review site. Each review is less than
    half the size of this blog post. That's about 2k. A page has 20
    reviews but because you don't have that much RAM, you need to read
    those 20 reviews from disk. It takes a quarter-second to just read the
    reviews from disk even with that fancy-pants storage array you
    bought.</p>

    <p>You're very lucky, your site has 10 million reviews. Continuing in
    my oversimplification, that's like 20 gigabytes. A gig of ECC FB-DIMM
    RAM is going for about $100/gig so that is 20k plus the extra 10k for
    the machines to hold your new RAM. 30k to automatically drop a quarter
    of a second from each request seems pretty cheap to me. Not only is
    your site faster but it now has more capacity since it's not wasting a
    quarter-second per request just moving a disk head around and reading
    data into memory where it should have been to begin with.</p>

    <p>One last point: It only feels like cheating because you have less
    to worry about and is more expensive. Unfortunately, there's a certain class of
    naive engineer who will think that they can build a system without the
    expense and with 99.9% of the gains. (naive engineers love to throw
    99.9% around!) They'll try to convince you that you just need another
    layer of LRU caches or some more memcached installations. They'll be a
    hero! They'll get a Founder's Award! Their company's VCs will take
    notice and promise to fund anything they start! Fire that guy. Use his
    salary to buy more RAM.</p>
