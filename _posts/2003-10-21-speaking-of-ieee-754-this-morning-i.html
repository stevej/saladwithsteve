Speaking of IEEE 754, this morning I read the paper <a href="http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/~wkahan/JAVAhurt.pdf">"How Java's Floating Point Hurts Everyone Everywhere"</a>. They take a pretty vituperative view of Java's inaccurate floating point arithmetic being passed off as proper  754. I agree; Sun ignored their whole army of numerical experts (who've implemented 754 in both hardware and software) in building Java and it shows everytime I want to catch a 754 Exception (not the same as a Java exception) but end up having to write tons of spaghetti code to "guarantee" that I wouldn't have to trap any of the 754 Exceptions.

    This paper's an interesting read.
