So I just remembered why I like handheld computers so much, I learned to program on <a href="http://www.rskey.org/pb700.htm">one</a> very early on. I haven't touched BASIC since. blech. And like most poor college kids out there, I used my Ti-85 as a PDA, writing basic apps like a calendar and addressbook in <a href="http://www.ticalc.org/basics/calculators/ti-85.html#9">zshell</a>.

    Today while contemplating whether to buy Wolfram's _A New Kind of Science_, I asked Stacy whether you could put a price on 20 years of life and work, she instantly replied "2 dollars!". I hadn't laughed that hard in a long time. <small>(She doesn't like Wolfram very much)</small>. I bought <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0521562473/qid%3D1022399722/ref%3Dsr%5F11%5F0%5F1/102-7543194-5964154">Lisp in Small Pieces</a> instead.
