It's my second day here at <a href="http://conferences.oreillynet.com/macosx2002/">OS X con</a> and things are pretty damn interesting. I'm not getting nearly enough sleep and the food leaves some to be desired but the company is great and the discussions are solid.
    <br /><br />
    I tried giving <a href="http://peerfear.org/">burton</a> a hand with his talk earlier but we quickly learned some of the nastiness of Mozilla as a platform. Pathnames.. 
    <br /><br />
    Paul Hoffman is about to give his talk on IPsec in Jaguar. should be good stuff.
    <br /><br />
    <b>Update:</b> phoffman's talk was quite useful, reminding me of a lot I had forgotten about IPsec. Along with KAME, <a href="http://www.kame.net/newsletter/20001119/">Racoon</a> is on OS X. much nicer than isakmpd. I had forgotten how much IPsec stinks when you throw NAT into the equation. blah.
