Funny, I count books in bus rides to work now. It took me 5 rides to finish <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0385509472/qid=1094757523/sr=8-1/ref=pd_cps_1/102-2362472-5080907?v=glance&amp;s=books&amp;n=507846">Diary</a> and 8 for <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0441007554/qid=1094757595/sr=ka-1/ref=pd_ka_1/102-2362472-5080907">All Tomorrow's Parties</a>. Both were really fun reads.

    10 rides for <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0130652083/qid=1094757641/sr=ka-1/ref=pd_ka_1/102-2362472-5080907">The WebDAV book</a>. Quick read for a 550-page tech book.
