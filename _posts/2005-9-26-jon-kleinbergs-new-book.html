title: "Jon Kleinberg's new Book"
---
<p>
    In honor of Jon Kleinberg's half-million dollar MacArthur Grant, I picked up his new book <a href="http://www.aw-bc.com/info/kleinberg/">Algorithm Design</a>. The first thing my coworker notices is a chapter on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PSPACE">PSPACE</a>. The first thing I notice is the discussion on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greedy_algorithm">Greedy Algorithms</a>. The chapter starts out with a quote from the movie 'Wall Street': "Greed is.. good!"

    Should provide some fun homework.
