Years and Years ago, I wrote some blog software in Python for an afternoon project, and lo and behold, <a href="http://crackrabbit.com/cgi-bin/blog.py?user=doug">it's being used still</a>. Somebody else took it and embedded it into their <a href="http://www.geekypenguin.org/">nice little homegrown content management system</a>. It's fun to think that the crap you write to kill an afternoon could take on a life of it's own.
