    <blockquote>"The marketing droids would have you believe that RAID is an answer to
    all of your storage wrongs. Bullshit. The most common cause of drive
    failure in modern enclosures is heat. When multiple drives share an
    enclosure, they tend to fail about the same time. We experienced this on
    Friday night, when two drives died within about 3 hours late one night."</blockquote>
