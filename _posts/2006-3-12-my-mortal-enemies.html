title: My mortal enemies.

<p>
    In my sleep last night, I muttered "<a href="http://www.tv.com/simpsons/homer-goes-to-college/episode/1369/summary.html">Crusty Old Dean</a>". I've taken <em>a lot</em> of cold medicine lately. Also, I have watched <a href="http://www.geocities.com/hollywood/hills/7350/">Real Genius</a> 3 times in 3 days.

    I am so grateful for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Co-amoxiclav">Augmentin</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nasacort">Nasacort</a>. Soon I will feel human again and my narrow <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eustachian_Tube">eustachian tubes</a> will stop conspiring to make my head feel like an overinflated balloon. Yes friends, it is ear infection season again.
