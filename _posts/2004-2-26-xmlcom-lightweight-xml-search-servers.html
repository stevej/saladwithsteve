<a href="http://www.xml.com/pub/a/2004/02/18/udell.html">XML.com: Lightweight XML Search Servers, Part 2 [Feb. 18, 2004]</a>: "This month's challenge  was to scale up to a database-backed implementation using Berkeley  DB XML." 
    <br /><br />
    I don't know if I'd use BerkeleyDB XML for this, I'm unsure of how fast it's XPath queries are; I know that it's locking is document-level, and I'd prefer Node-level locking. (Is Node-level locking possible?)
