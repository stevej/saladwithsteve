title: "MCL and the chocolate factory"

Well, I'm about to purchase my first commercial Common Lisp environment. <a href="http://digitool.com">MCL</a>'s price has dropped to 95$, pending a new release that is Carbonized so I've decided to help my fellow independant software developer and buy MCL even though I can't run it native. Part of my motivation is selfish, I'm hoping when the next version comes out, which will be Carbonized, I'll get a decent upgrade price. Who am I kidding, all of my motivation here is selfish, this looks like fun!

    I've mucked a little with <a href="http://portableaserve.sourceforge.net/">Portable AllegroServe</a> lately, and am trying to get the hang of <a href="http://lemonodor.com/archives/000128.html">LSP</a> but I'm starting to see why wiseman considers it mostly a failure. Honestly, it's no less failure than JSP, PHP, etc. They're all kind of ugly in their own way, LSP is just ugly in it's own special way.
