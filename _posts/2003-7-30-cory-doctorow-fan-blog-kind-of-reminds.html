The <a href="http://neologasm.org/doctorow/">Cory Doctorow Fan Blog</a> kind of reminds me of a platonic <a href="http://www.geocities.com/pyrafan/">EvLover</a>. <a href="http://similarselection.org/goldtoe/">Goldtoe</a> says that he'll start a fan blog devoted to me. Here's how he claims it'd look:
    <br /><br /><em>
    Wednesday, April 2<br />
    Today, Steve's wearing a black teeshirt.<br /><br />
    Thursday, April 3<br />
    Steve's wearing another of his Famous Black Teeshirts again<br /><br />
    Friday, April 4<br />
    Steve's mixing it up with a blue Blogger shirt today.
    </em>
    <br /><br />
    
    (I added that last entry). Yeah, I wear a lot of black band tshirts. And Blogger tshirts. It's kind of lame.
