title: Bill Joy wants to require insurance for risky research
---
Bill Joy <a href="http://nanodot.org/article.pl?sid=04/06/15/0149240"> "[...] says he believes that businesses doing research in areas deemed risky by their peers should be forced to take out insurance against catastrophes. He also says that science guilds should have the authority to limit access to potentially dangerous ideas."</a>
    <br /><br />
    "There's no better way to stimulate innovation than to put a pillow over it's face and press down. firmly. oh so firmly.." says Joy.
