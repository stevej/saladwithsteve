    <a href="http://www.channelregister.co.uk/2007/08/07/google_joins_open_invention_network/">
    All OIN members - including big names such as IBM, NEC, Novell, Philips, Red Hat, and Sony, as well as Google - agree not to use their Linux-related patents against each other, and all have free access to a collection of additional open-source-related patents purchased by the consortium as a whole.

    Seems like a good idea.</a> Somebody will eventually have to take out Barzini, though.
