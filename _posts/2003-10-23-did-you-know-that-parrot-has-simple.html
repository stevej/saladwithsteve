Did you know that Parrot has a simple FORTH implementation inside of it? Every developer eventually realizes that the thing his favorite language needs is another language embedded inside of it. <a href="http://www.apl.jhu.edu/~hall/Lisp-Notes/Macros.html">Some people</a> <a href="http://www.erights.org/elang/grammar/quasi-overview.html">discover this</a> <a href="http://www.sidhe.org/~dan/blog/archives/000258.html">sooner than</a> <a href="http://www.jython.org/">others</a>.

    <strong>Update</strong>: Some people think I've misread Dan's post. They think FORTH is simply one of the languages implemented in Parrot. But what I think he's doing is implementing complex Parrot instructions as FORTH, since doing so in FORTH is so low cost (for example: you don't pay anything for a subroutine call beyond the jump cost).
