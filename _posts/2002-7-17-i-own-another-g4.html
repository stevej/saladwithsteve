i own another g4. Ev was selling his old g4 for a solid price and a guy who was going to buy it didn't show up so I pulled out my checkbook and took it home.

    I now own more working apple hardware than x86 hardware. See, I have 5 broken x86 boxes in my closet. 5 broken g4's would cost me a whole helluva lot more. Here's to ruggedness, renter's insurance, and a rubber carpet.
