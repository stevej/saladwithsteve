    Sadly, it's the exact economic model of it's predecessor, Total Annihilation. I always liked the throughput model of TA but it's been 10 years and I would have liked to see something new. What I like most about SupCom are the experimental units; they're the only thing that separate the three identical sides and is the main difference from TA. It seems most game designers don't understand more than a shallow sense of balance and SupCom is another example of that. I guess they are hoping the modders will do their job for them.

    Here's my snarky take on it: It's a really nice platform but it's too bad they only released a demo game with it.
