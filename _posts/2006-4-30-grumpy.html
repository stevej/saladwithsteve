<p>
    If you see me and I'm grumpy, it's because I entered escrow on a house here in San Francisco. In the Central Richmond, near <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?hl=en&lr=&safe=off&q=20th+Ave+%26+Geary+Blvd,+San+Francisco,+CA+94121&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8&t=h&om=1&ll=37.780297,-122.479384&spn=0.015433,0.033989">20th and Geary</a>. It's a great place, we're really stoked but there is a lot of work to do to get a mortgage. I've filled out several dozen forms so far. Things will probably let up next week after I'm approved.

    I'm going to invite the entire internet over for a house-warming party! I hope it has an ID card so it can buy beer.
