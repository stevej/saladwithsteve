Getting <a href="http://www.pygame.org/">pygame</a> 1.5.5 to build on redhat 9 hinges on a few things: 
    <ul>
    <li>Knowing that ft_open_stream has been deprecated in the version of freetype2 that's been shipped with redhat 9 in favor of FT_OPEN_STREAM</li>
    <li>Patching SDL_ttf to not gack when it looks for ft_open_stream</li>
    <li>Using the smpeg and smpeg-devel rpms from redhat 7.3 and not from the loki site.</li>
    </ul>
    
    Phew. It would have really helped me out if somebody else had written the above on their own blog and that had been in google.
