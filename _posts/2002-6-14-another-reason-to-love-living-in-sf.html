Another reason to love living in SF, we get a lot of great conferences. The <a href="http://www.international-lisp-conference.org/">International Conference on Lisp 2002</a> is being held in October in downtown SF.
    <br /><br />
    I'm only interested in days 1 (talks about Lisp and Functional Languages in general) and 2 (Lisp in Web Applications). 
    <br /><br />
    Of course, we'll never get <a href="http://fc02.ai">Financial Cryptography</a>. I think it's held in the West Indies next year. Besides the 2 grand price tag, I have no excuse to not go.
