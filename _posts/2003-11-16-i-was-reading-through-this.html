I was reading through this developerWorks article: <a href="http://www-106.ibm.com/developerworks/eserver/articles/hook_duttaC.html?ca=dgr-lnxw02BestC">'Best Practices for Programming in C'</a> when I noticed that the prose and code examples seemed really familiar. Then I remembered Rob Pike's old <a href="http://www.lysator.liu.se/c/pikestyle.html">'Notes on Programming in C'</a>. The similiarity seems more than accidental.
