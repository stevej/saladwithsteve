I'm aggregated as part of the <a href="http://www.xach.com/planet-lisp/">Planet Lisp</a> metablog. Cool. I had no idea until I had read halfway down the page. Too bad it doesn't have an Atom or RSS feed, though.
    <br /><br />
    Earlier this week, I ported a 14-year-old Common Lisp code coverage tool to OpenMCL. Not much porting was required, just moving away from some deprecated functions relating to packaging. 
    <br /><br />
    Ironic, the code coverage tool has no test suite so I don' t know if all of the IO code works.
    <br /><br />
    I'll clean it up and put the code and diffs online in a few days.
