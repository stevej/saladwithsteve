title: "Ripping Off Wikipedia"
---
An entry on Encyclopedia4U called <a href="http://www.encyclopedia4u.com/n/naive-bayesian-classification.html">"Naive Bayesian classification"</a> didn't make any sense to me until I realized that it was a ripoff of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naive_Bayesian_classification">this</a> <a href="http://wikipedia.org/">Wikipedia article</a> minus the formulas but with ads plastered all over it.
    <br /><br />
    Yes, this is what I do on Friday nights. And Stacy is here laughing at some poor sucker's blog as he fights his personal struggle against pornography. I guess he feels the needs to protect his Purity of Essence. PoE.

    I just want a good article on naive bayesian classifiers.
