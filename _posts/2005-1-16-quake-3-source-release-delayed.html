title: "Quake 3 Source Release Delayed"
---
On John Carmack's <a href="http://www.armadilloaerospace.com/n.x/johnc/Recent%20Updates">blog</a>, he <a href="http://www.armadilloaerospace.com/n.x/johnc/recent%20updates/archive?news_id=290">says</a>:
    <blockquote>
    I intended to release the Q3 source under the GPL by the end of 2004, but we had another large technology licensing deal go through, and it would be poor form to make the source public a few months after a company paid hundreds of thousands of dollars for full rights to it. True, being public under the GPL isn’t the same as having a royalty free license without the need to disclose the source, but I’m pretty sure there would be some hard feelings.

    I am still committed to making as much source public as I can, and I won’t wait until the titles from the latest deal have actually shipped, but it is still going to be a little while before I feel comfortable doing the release.
    </blockquote>
    That sounds like about a year to me.
