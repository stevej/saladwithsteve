Berkeley/Stanford <a href="http://roc.cs.berkeley.edu/">ROC</a>'s <a href="http://citebase.eprints.org/cgi-bin/citations?id=oai:arXiv.org:cs/0406005">microrebootable platform</a> would mesh well with <a href="http://www.eecs.harvard.edu/~mdw/proj/seda/">SEDA</a> I feel. You'd just need to separate SEDAs event   
    queues from the stage so you could reboot the stage without losing your events. Since microreboots are supposed to take on the order of milliseconds, throughput is supposed to stay high while latency only increases a little bit. That's the theory anyway.

    Eclipse is bad-ass. I've been having memory problems with Emacs lately (Since there's no XEmacs for OS X yet, I'm stuck with GNU Emacs) and this month's Dr. Dobbs had three articles on Eclipse (a lot for an issue on distributed computing but I guess you can only publish so many articles on Linda) so I decided to try it out. It really is quite nice. I'm going to use it for the next week or so and see if I can kick a decade-long Emacs habit. I've alredy found replacements for my 10 favorite Emacs plugins.

    I used Comcast's On Demand cable service tonight. I watched 6 minutes from The Daily Show. The future happened last week apparently; they sent me a piece of snail mail letting me know that I had it and that it was on Channel 1.

    One last thing: if you feel your productivity at work slipping, remember Ole Eichorn's advise and <a href="http://w-uh.com/articles/030308-tyranny_of_email.html">turn your email client off.</a> IM, too. Strangely, it's easy to forget to keep them turned off.
