From <a href="http://no-sword.sieve.net/">Matt</a>'s blog: (he's an australian teaching english at a school in Japan)
    
    <blockquote><i>My school has a uniform. The boys all wear grey long pants and a white short-sleeved shirt. Many of the more strong-willed boys choose to express their individuality by unbuttoning the top two or three or as-many-as-they-dare buttons on that shirt, then lounging about in this half-opened ensemble like Leisure Suit Larry on valium.

    Sometimes there are so many scrawny chests on display in my classes that I feel like I'm teaching a gang of malnourished pirates. Which is ironic, because many of them have trouble making the "r" sound properly, and that's essential if you're going to be saying "Arrr!"
