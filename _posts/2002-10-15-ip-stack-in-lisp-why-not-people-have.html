title: IP stack in lisp. Why not? People have been doing it for 25 years.
---
source code reading for tonight: <a href="http://advogato.org/person/lukeg/">Luke Gorrie's</a> IP stack in Common Lisp: <a href="http://cvs.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/slitch/slitch/">Slitch</a>. So far, he seems to be handling ARP pretty well. My common lispery is weak enough that I still have trouble following everything. No better way to brush up, I suppose.

    This weekend I spent some quality time with my new Blogger client. Things are really coming together. I took care of lots of little things and also ripped out the old XMLRPC code and replaced it all with calls to the new Jaguar <a href="http://developer.apple.com/techpubs/macosx/Networking/WebServices/1_intro_folder/index.html?http://developer.apple.com/techpubs/macosx/Networking/WebServices/1_intro_folder/XML_RPC_vs._SOAP.html">CoreServices.h</a> stuff. I still have a few things to take care of before I'll feel like releasing it: <a href="http://developer.apple.com/techpubs/macosx/Essentials/SystemOverview/SoftwareConfig/The_Preferences_System.html">Preferences</a> and <a href="http://developer.apple.com/techpubs/macosx/Cocoa/TasksAndConcepts/ProgrammingTopics/SysServices/iusing.html">Services</a>.
    <br /><br />
    Bill Bumgarner was nice enough to send me the source to his RadioService code about 6 months ago so that's been useful, and Preferences really
    isn't difficult, I just need to get a non-horrible looking UI for storing Prefs.

    In non-geek news, I had dim sum (plus American food) at Stacy's brother's house in Hayward this weekend. I had a pork bun and stacy's niece licked
    the fridge. A ridiculously cute child. Then we all ate cake and watched <a href="http://www.thewiggles.com/">The Wiggles</a>. Australian childrens television at it's most...
    australian?
