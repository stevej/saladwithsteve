title: reddit redone in Python
---
Reddit has been rewritten from Common Lisp to Python. Sadly, Common Lisp is stuck in 1994 unless you are willing to tie yourself to one specific implementation and bet the farm on it. And the probability that the tools you need will work on that specific implementation? It's a random walk, unfortunately.

    <a href="http://reddit.com/blog/2005/12/night-of-living-python.html">reddit: what's new online</a>: "Visiting reddit today, you may notice that things seem a little different. It's not just your imagination -- as our series of header icons hinted at, the site has been entirely rewritten in Python during some marathon coding sessions over the past couple weeks."
