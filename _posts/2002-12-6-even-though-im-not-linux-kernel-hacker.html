Even though I'm not a Linux Kernel hacker I really enjoy KernelTrap's articles. This week they <a href="http://kerneltrap.org/node.php?id=517">interview</a> Ingo Molnar about his recent work on the O(1) scheduler in the 2.5 kernel and his history with the kernel. He makes a few comments on the BitKeeper controversy.
