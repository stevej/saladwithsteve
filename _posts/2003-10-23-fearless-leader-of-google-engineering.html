Fearless Leader of Google Engineering, Wayne Rosing has a <a href="http://www.acmqueue.com/modules.php?name=Content&pa=showpage&pid=62&page=1">really good interview</a> in this month's ACM Queue. I'm one of the (very?) few engineers in Google without at least a bachelor's degree. When we were being acquired, Wayne said that my lack of a degree didn't matter because 1) it was obvious that I could do my job since I had already done it, and 2) he didn't have a degree, either.

    That made me glad to be joining.
