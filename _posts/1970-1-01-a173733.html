yay! We launched the first wave of our beta release of the new version of Blogger. If you have a free or pro account, feel free to create a new Blog, it'll ask if you want to be part of the new beta program. Don't be shy; give it a whirl.

    One of the new features I wrote is a group of two changes.xml files; one which is a 3-hour version updated every half-hour and the other is a 10-minute version updated every 3 minutes. Sutter came up with some pretty templates for me to use for the <a href="http://new.blogger.com/changes10.html">10-minute</a> and <a href="http://new.blogger.com/changes.html" title="WATCH OUT! This is a multi-megabyte file">3-hour</a> html versions. Watch out, that 3-hour variant is a multi-megabyte file.
