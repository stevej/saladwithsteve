I'm reminded that I also have a blog! <a href="http://contraversion.com/">Stacy</a> and I tried out <a href="http://sanfrancisco.citysearch.com/profile/905614/">Q</a> this weekend. Oh Man! Probably the best burger I've had since moving to the bay area. A little trendy but man, that was a tasty chocolate italian soda.. uhh, that does nothing to negate the trendiness, I understand. No need for a conjunction there. Still..
    <br /><br />
    Then I hacked a little ruby while <a href="http://contraversion.com/">whats-her-face</a> made ridiculously tasty <a href="http://contraversion.com/index.php?p=blogarchive/2003_07_01_archive.php#105806008943186991">Beef Stroganoff</a>. If you like meat (and some of you here do, I'm sure), you should try out this recipe.  
    <!--
    We were somewhere outside of Barstow, on the edge of the desert, when the Stroganoff began to take hold. I remember yelling something like "Holy Jesus, what is this goddamned Beef Heroin?" while my lawyer sat pouring cognac-infused faux russian cuisine down her gullet. "I feel a bit light headed" and my Pakistani-Canadian compadre took over the wheel. No sense telling her about the Beef Heroin, she'll dig into that rotten stuff soon enough.
