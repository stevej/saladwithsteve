From Joey's sidebar:
    "Steve Jenson -- All-round sweet guy, one of the fine people behind Blogger, former co-worker of mine and an aficionado of punk, programming languages and freezer vodka." I forget that not too many other people keep their vodka in the icebox. It's much easier to drink straight out the bottle that way.
