I was worried after <a href="http://wimp.com/">Wiley and Sons</a> wussed out of publishing <a href="http://www.xenatera.com/aboutus.htm">Andrew Huang</a>'s book on reverse engineering the xbox. Now it appears that a small independant book company, <a href="http://www.nostarch.com/xbox.htm">No Starch Press</a>, has picked it up. There are chapter samples on <a href="http://www.xenatera.com/hackingthexbox/index.html">Huang's site</a>.
    <br /><br />
    Oh yeah, and don't forget about <a href="http://xbox-linux.sourceforge.net/">xbox-linux</a>
