Get a <a href="http://cgi.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&item=3039193282&category=11213">Quad Processor Dell running BeOS 5</a> on ebay. Not a BeBox, but it's interesting that somebody is auctioning this off as a BeOS _server_. I spent weeks trying to get the sshd from ssh-1.2.27 to compile on BeOS 4.5 back in 1999.

    I've always dug the Be Look 'n' Feel but hated writing applications in C++. Contrast that with OS X where I'm only so-so about the Look 'n' Feel but really dig OpenStep.

    <strong>Update:</strong> Speaking of which, in 9 days, it'll be <a href="http://beos.meetup.com/">International BeOS Meetup Day</a>. I didn't know they had a monthly meetup.
