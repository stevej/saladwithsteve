Chuck Palahniuk recently gave an interview to Entertainment Weekly and asked that certain parts be left out. Apparently the writer decided that it was too juicy to not publish so Chuck has outed himself on his website rather than face further public embarassment. It sounds like there's a lot of back story waiting to surface.<br /><br />
