Oh hot dog! WYSIWYG editing in Blogger. I'm working from home today with a cold so I forgot this was making it in today. I squealed like a girl when I read CW's <a href="http://www.massless.org/?archive=2004/07/note-on-usefulness-of-wysiwyg-editing">post:</a>
    <blockquote>
    One solution, implemented now at Blogger, is to create a mixed-mode enviroment for WYSIWYG where a user can enter rich styling and HTML and have both work.  So (as coined by <a href="http://goldtoe.net/">Jason "Mr. Product" Goldman</a>) the result is more of a WYSI-M-WYG or 'What You See Is Mostly What You Get' editor.</blockquote>Oh man, I've been waiting <span style="font-weight: bold;">forever</span> for this! It's so much better than any other WYSIWYG editor I've ever used on the web.
