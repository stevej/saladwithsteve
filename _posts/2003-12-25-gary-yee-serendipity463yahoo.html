    Gary Yee took my money from an Ebay auction and never sent me anything. Because I tried to resolve the problem through arbitration, as Ebay requested, I'm now a few days over Ebay's <strong>arbitrary</strong> 60-day limit to file for Fraud Protection and will never see a penny back. Thanks Ebay! Thanks Gary Yee!

    If you want to send Gary Yee an <a href="mailto:serendipity463@yahoo.com?subject=Send Steve his stuff, jerk-off">email</a>, feel free to.

    <strong>Update:</strong> Stacy just found a phone number for that address (I tried digging one up but was unsuccessful): (808) 988-3448. I'll try it in a few days and let everybody know.
