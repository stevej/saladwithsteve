Very rarely do I have a restaurant recommendation but tonight stacy and I had dinner at this great place called <a href="http://bayarea.citysearch.com/profile/907710/">Bistro 1650</a> on the corner of Balboa and 18th Avenue.I had the duck and panfried zucchini ravioli with a chicken matzah ball soup while stacy ate mussels and rotelli in a tremendous white wine sauce. We brought some desserts home, I'll let you know.

    More than the food (well, equal to the food, which was amazing), the restaurant owner was just the most personable guy you could hope to meet.
