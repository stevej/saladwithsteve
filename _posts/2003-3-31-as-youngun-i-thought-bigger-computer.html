As a young'un, I thought the bigger computer must be the faster computer. It seems I never got over that because <a href="http://www.tomshardware.com/mobile/20020306/">my new thinkpad</a> is a freaking monster.  But it's worth every pound; a really bright display with a 1600x1200 resolution was my main reason for picking it up and it's turned out to be quite excellent. Nevermind that I had to buy another bag just so I could lug it around.

    Linux as a desktop has grown up a lot in the year since I left. Anti-aliased fonts and a font-server that understands them are now part of the standard redhat 8 distribution which means that Mozilla finally looks nice under X. 'Neat' makes swiching between wireless networks a breeze and Redhat Network Update is as convenient as Apple's Software Update. I've updated my kernel and system libraries via it without a hitch.  If you were to turn the console boot messages into a twirling fruity logo, I'd hardly remember I was using linux.

    <a href="http://www.linuxjournal.com/article.php?sid=6476">Bluecurve</a> was <a href="http://www.gluch.org.mx/~ion/gallery/screenshots/rh8_1.jpg">nice</a> but <a href="http://www.windowmaker.org/">WindowMaker</a> is still my preference.
