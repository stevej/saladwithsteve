title: Petty little princes

<p>
    I am tired of the Java-Python-Ruby battles. I'm tired of hearing about the trivial differences between two Smalltalk children and one Modula 3 child. I'm tired of the "Java sux0rz! Ruby r0x0rz!" attitude that the Ruby fanboys are piling on with. I'm tired of Pythonistas falling for the trap and assuming they must build a Rails killer to "win". And Java fans take the bait, too, battling over accessors and iterators while sitting on a language with great IO and multilingual facilities. It's not like any of them are that great but they are all certainly servicable for now.
