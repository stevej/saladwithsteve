title: A real-life cold case.
---
Back in July, I received a jury duty summons. I didn't end up serving but it took 3 long days for the lawyers to finish selecting it. It was for <a href="http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2007/08/17/BALURK067.DTL&amp;hw=john+davis&amp;sn=001&amp;sc=1000">a 20 year old rape and murder case</a> considered San Francisco's first real Cold Case. It looks like that jury just entered deliberation.
