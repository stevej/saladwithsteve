<p>
    <a href="http://railsday.com/blog/">Rails Day</a> sounded like fun. I've been sick so I didn't participate. <small>(Plus, what's up with the fact that if you want to use a database then you have to use MySQL?)</small>
    </p>

    I did write something, though. It's a small ruby class intended to be <code>require</code>d in CGI scripts that can install an at_exit handler to pick up whichever stray <code>Exception</code> killed your program and output it as nice HTML. It's pretty similar to what Python's <a href="http://www.python.org/doc/current/lib/module-cgitb.html"><code>cgitb</code></a> module provides.

    Anybody interested in being a guinea pig? Err, I mean beta tester.
