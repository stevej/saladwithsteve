I've been fighting off a cold these past few days, trying to balance resting and defeating the enemy: midnight code.<P>
    It's 4am and I should definitely be asleep but I'm the victim of that nagging "could be a sore throat but it isn't quite" funkiness.

    Geekbooks.org has been on my mind. So has smart contracts and a rebirth of a highly paired-down yet useful <acronym title="AMerican Information eXchange">AMIX</acronym>. Don't ask about either of these, I'll deny having mentioned them.
    <P>
    I see that MarkM put a new directory in the E cvs tree for 8.10delta release, I'm glad to see progress is moving along steadily. I really want to start hacking again in E.

    Cannon's having a big xmas bash at his place on Saturday. Chocolate Fondue? Speaking of which,   Star Wars: Starfighter has cleaned a lot of right-brain blockage lately. I've solved some of my hardest code problems blasting my way through Trade Federation blockades and flying through tight canyons. I've also died a lot in the game from lack of focus. Oh well. I'm a much better shot than I was with the original X-Wing for the PC.
