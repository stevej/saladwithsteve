<a href="http://www.google.com/googleblog/2004/06/man-plan-pointless-program.html">From the Google Blog</a>: "Hoey is an excellent computer scientist, but he said he spent days writing a disk-based B-tree package for his program. I was saved all this, because a dictionary now fits in main memory and I could use straightforward binary search. Thank you, Moore's Law."

    As they say, memory is the new disk and disk is the new tape.
