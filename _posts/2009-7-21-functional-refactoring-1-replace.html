title: "Functional Refactoring #1: Replace conditional inside fold with filter."
location: San Francisco, CA

<p>
    Recently, while working on some code, I noticed that I have been making the same transform on lots of functional code in Scala. I think it's clearly a Refactoring and should have a name.

    <h4>"Replace conditional inside fold with filter"</h4>
    </p>

    <p>
    The idea is that if you're folding over items in a list and manipulating them based on a conditional, it might be clearer if you pull out the conditional and filter the list on that conditional first.
    </p>
    <p>
    Here is a contrived example borrowed from a fake test suite. Let's say I had code with a conditional inside of a fold:
    </p>
    <p>
    {% highlight scala %}
    sampleUsers.values.foreach { u =>
      if (u.id != 0) {
        Authentication(u.id, u.hash).passwordToken mustEqual u.passwordToken
      }
    }
    {% endhighlight %}
    </p>
    <p>
    Let's apply this refactoring to make the test case clearer.
    </p>
    <p>
      {% highlight scala %}
    sampleUsers.values.filter(u => u.id != 0).foreach { u =>
      Authentication(u.id, u.hash).passwordToken mustEqual u.passwordToken
    }
      {% endhighlight %}
    </p>
    <p>
    This works with multiple inner conditionals as well. You can fit them into one filter or chain multiple filters together.
    </p>
    <p>
    Even though this is a simple refactoring, it seems like a worthwhile place to start cataloging.
    </p>
