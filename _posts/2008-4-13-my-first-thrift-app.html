    When you find yourself working on big systems, a useful technique is
    to decompose it into services. Moving from a big monolithic server to
    a bunch of separate services can be a big challenge but if you had
    foresight, many of your services were already decoupled in your system
    from day 1 even though you were deploying it monolithicly.
    </p>
    <p>
    A common technique for decomposing services is using RPC. At Google, we
    used protocol buffers, which were briefly descibed in the <a href="http://labs.google.com/papers/sawzall-sciprog.pdf">Sawzall</a>
    paper.
    </p>
    <p>
    Basically, you describe your data and the interface that process the
    data in a language-independent format (a DDL, essentially) and use code
    generators to turn that DDL into set of objects in your target
    langauge that can create and send those structures over the wire. This
    makes it easy to write servers in one language and clients in another
    and the generated code deals with serialization.
    </p>
    <p>
    I found that using a DDL to describe your code and services was really
    nice. When building a new service, you could simply reference your DDL
    in the design doc and have a meanginful discussion about the service
    without getting into the details of how it would be written until you had
    the semantics nailed down.
    </p>

    <p>
    Facebook, as they were growing, decided to move to a homegrown binary
    RPC mechanism similar to protocol buffers called <a href="http://developers.facebook.com/thrift/">Thrift</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
    Let's say I wanted to write a simple service that would tell the
    client what time it was on the server. Here would be the DDL file
    describing both the data and the service plus a little extra to help
    out the generated code files.
    </p>
    <pre name="code" class="thrift">
    # time.thrift
    namespace java tserver.gen
    namespace ruby TServer.Gen

    typedef i64 Timestamp

    service TimeServer {
    // Simply returns the current time.
    Timestamp time()
    }
    </pre>

    <p>
    After running <tt>thrift --gen java --gen rb time.thrift</tt> on the
    file, I'd have an interface and server that I could implement in Java
    and a client that I could use in Ruby.
    </p>
    <p>
    Based on the generated java code, I could write a short server in Scala:
    </p>

    <pre name="code" class="scala">
    <code>
    package tserver

    import tserver.gen._
    import com.facebook.thrift.TException
    import com.facebook.thrift.TProcessor
    import com.facebook.thrift.TProcessorFactory
    import com.facebook.thrift.protocol.TProtocol
    import com.facebook.thrift.protocol.TProtocolFactory
    import com.facebook.thrift.transport.TServerTransport
    import com.facebook.thrift.transport.TServerSocket
    import com.facebook.thrift.transport.TTransport
    import com.facebook.thrift.transport.TTransportFactory
    import com.facebook.thrift.transport.TTransportException
    import com.facebook.thrift.server.TServer
    import com.facebook.thrift.server.TThreadPoolServer
    import com.facebook.thrift.protocol.TBinaryProtocol

    /**
    * TimeServer.time returns the current time according to the server.
    */
    class TimeServer extends TimeServer.Iface {
    override def time: Long = {
    val now = System.currentTimeMillis
    println("somebody just asked me what time it is: " + now)
    now
    }
    }

    object SimpleServer extends Application {
    try {
    val serverTransport = new TServerSocket(7911)
    val processor = new TimeServer.Processor(new TimeServer())
    val protFactory = new TBinaryProtocol.Factory(true, true)
    val server = new TThreadPoolServer(processor, serverTransport,
    protFactory)
    
    println("starting server")
    server.serve();     
    } catch { 
    case x: Exception =&gt; x.printStackTrace();
    }
    }
    </code>
    </pre>

    <p>
    (Geez, most of that space was taken up in my obsessive need to separate
    out all my imports. You can thank Google for that bit of OCD.)
    </p>
    <p>
    The client is even shorter:
    </p>
    <pre name="code" class="ruby">
    <code>
    #!/usr/bin/ruby
    $:.push('~/thrift/lib/rb/lib')
    $:.push('../gen-rb')

    require 'thrift/transport/tsocket'
    require 'thrift/protocol/tbinaryprotocol'
    require 'TimeServer'

    transport = TBufferedTransport.new(TSocket.new("localhost", 7911))
    protocol = TBinaryProtocol.new(transport)
    client = TimeServer::Client.new(protocol)

    transport.open()

    puts "I wonder what time it is. Let's ask!"
    puts client.time()
    </code>
    </pre>
    <p>
    The ruby client took about 20ms to get an answer from the Scala server.
    </p>
    <p>
    Thrift advantages:<br />
    <ul>
    <li>Pipelined connections means you spend less time in connection setup/teardown and TCP likes longer-lived connections.</li>
    <li>Asynchronous requests. Asynchronous replies would be nice too but would be trickier to use.</li>
    <li>Binary representation is much more efficient to transmit and process than, say, XML.</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
    Thrift drawbacks: <br />
    <ul>
    <li>Integrating generated source into your build system can be tricky. 
    Typically, you rarely have to regenerate your stubs but debugging generated code can be a huge pain.</li>
    <li>It's Java server should move away from ServerSocket to NIO for increased throughput. 
    That's probably not more than a week's work as long as the existing code isn't too tightly coupled.</li>
    <li>Currently it doesn't build cleanly on the Mac. I did some work and got it working but I don't think it's used
    extensively on the Mac so if that's your primary platform, you should be prepared to send them patches from time to time.</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
    If you're looking to move towards decoupled services, Thrift is worth a hard look.

    Here's a tarball with my <a href="http://saladwithsteve.com//code/timeserver.tar.gz">time
    server</a>. It contains all the generated code as well as
    libthrift.jar and a Makefile to run the example server.
