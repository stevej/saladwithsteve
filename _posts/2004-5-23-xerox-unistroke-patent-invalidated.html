title: "Xerox Unistroke Patent Invalidated."
---
<cite><a href="http://www.palminfocenter.com/view_story.asp?ID=6837">The Xerox patent in question is U.S. Patent No. 5,596,656, which covered unistroke symbols. The court held that the patent was invalid because, "The prior art references anticipate and render obvious the claim," or that the unistroke system was not a unique invention.</a></cite>
