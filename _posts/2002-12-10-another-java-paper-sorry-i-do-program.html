Another Java <a href="http://www-106.ibm.com/developerworks/library/it/it-1001art24/index.html?dwzone=ibm">paper</a>: Sorry, I do program in it for a living after all. This one makes some really good points; one point in particular debunks the myth that <tt>int</tt>s are 32-bits wide in the JVM. Language lawyers will argue (and win) that <tt>int</tt>s are only specified within a range and that the <a title="Java Language Specification">JLS</a> doesn't specify how wide an <tt>int</tt> is in the JVM but merely that the number can't be larger than 2147483648 (2^31) and therefore an <tt>int</tt> could be any width inside the VM. This paper also clarifies what a 'critical' section of code really is as opposed to what people usually call 'critical' sections of code.
