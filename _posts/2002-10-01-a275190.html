I own yet another computer. <a href="http://www.pyra.com/">We</a> bought some 1u 800Mhz boxes dirt cheap at a dot com fire sale and I carted one home. They're all sans cover so it's a loud monster. But since there's no cover, there's no airflow so I kicked it down a few decibles by unplugging all the fans.

    Thanks to bbum for sending me some notes regarding WebServices under Jaguar as I've been borrowing knowledge from his wonderful RadioServices code
