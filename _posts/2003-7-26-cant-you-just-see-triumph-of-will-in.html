Can't you just see Triumph of the Will in <a href="http://gnomedex3.blogspot.com/2003_07_01_gnomedex3_archive.html#105915285542240413">this shot</a> of <a href="http://nelson.monkey.org/~nelson/weblog/">Nelson</a>? I'm sorry, I have a history half-degree focusing on WWII, I can't help these kinds of things.. Plus the juxtaposition between Nelson's normally easy-going manner with that crazed Fuhrer pose is too hilarious to pass up.
