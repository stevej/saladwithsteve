Sony today <a href="http://www.gamespydaily.com/news/fullstory.asp?id=5297">unveiled concrete specs</a> for their new handheld. The short and skinny: 33 million <a title="textured and lit">t&l</a>'d <a title="polygons per second">pps</a>, WiFi,  1.8Gb media, and 2 <a href="http://216.239.33.104/search?q=cache:FMQKvVZYE-MJ:www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~cs9242/current/doc/R4400_Uman_book_Ed2.pdf+r4000&hl=en&ie=UTF-8">R4000</a>/333's. Not being content to call a "chip" a "chip", Sony has called the second R4000 a "PSP Media Engine".

    I hope you enjoy reading this article in your "Hypertext Rendering Engine" as much as I've enjoyed typing this on my "Human-Computer-Interfacial Engine".

    Anyway, two chips in a system is nothing new, really, although it would have seemed obvious to me to at least use a different kind of processor for the "Media Engine" unless they wanted to confuse people into thinking it was an SMP machine. Maybe they have a trick up their sleeve.

    But hey, it'll give me an excuse to brush up on my MIPS assembly. I have a R5000 sitting in my closet right now. Maybe I should throw NetBSD on that and poke around.
