    Aunt Linda gave the Roman Forum a 'Wha??' and a 'Oh Brother'.

    I was struck by a ray of light in the Pantheon. It started to talk to me but I excused myself as I would with any other panhandler.

    At the Spanish Steps, a guy "guessed" I was American and said I looked like Tom Cruise. I "guessed" he was a bad pickpocket and fled.
