Did you know that you can get a P4 1.7Ghz machine with plenty of expansion bays and pci slots from Dell for only 399$? I don't mean to sound like that dorky Dell Faux Stoner but damn that's cheap. Remember when everybody was talking about the sub-500$ PC being the next big thing and the rest of us were naysaying the idea based on our experiences with expensive homemade machines? We were fools. Dell has definitely figured it out. Of course, prices were bound to drop but to drop as much as they have for equipment this decent was beyond my expectations.

    I was still quite skeptical of the sub-500$ PC until today; I spent all afternoon in front of one of those stock 399$ Dell machines thinking it was just a server that somebody had taken the RAM out of.
