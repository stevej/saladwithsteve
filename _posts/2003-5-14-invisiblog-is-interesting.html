<a href="http://invisiblog.com/info/posting/">Invisiblog</a> is interesting. I like how you don't have to trust them to post content to a blog. I dislike the usability issues of having a blog id'd by it's public key fingerprint. Did they read <a href="http://zooko.com/distnames.html">Zooko's names article?</a> Which two properties did they choose? (I don't think they chose any of them, I'm just being a meany-pants about their difficult to remember blog names.) <small>[via a blog I read last night but forgot who. If it was yours, please email me. thanks!]</small>
