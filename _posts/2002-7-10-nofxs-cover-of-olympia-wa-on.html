NoFX's cover of "Olympia, WA"  on the Rancid/NoFX <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000062T9Q/qid=1026328130/sr=8-3/ref=sr_8_3/104-4330181-6308752">split</a> is as good as Rancid's original. It'd be great if I could share that with all of you via Napster/KaZaa/whatever (seeing as neither the bands nor their labels mind mp3) but Big Music removed that choice for everybody.

    I never did hear back from that bank.
