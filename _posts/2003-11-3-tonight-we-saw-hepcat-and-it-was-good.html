Tonight we saw Hepcat and it was <a title="Push 'n' Shove" href="http://media.epitaph.com/epicenter/core/36/102/998.mp3">good.</a> It's been 6 years! After <a href="http://www.cbs.com/primetime/becker/cast04.shtml">Alex landed a TV gig</a>, I figured the band was done for. It was pretty well known that him and Greg (the other singer) hated each other. Surprise, surpise. It was really a great show.
