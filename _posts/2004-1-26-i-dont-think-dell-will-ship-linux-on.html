title: I don't think Dell will ship linux on a laptop this year.
---
<a href="http://www.peerfear.org/rss/permalink/2004/01/25/DellIn2004/">Kevin Burton</a> and I have a bet. He says that Dell will ship linux on a laptop this year. I say that won't happen. We think that the long wait to Longhorn will make people itch for a new desktop. I say that those who itch will switch. To apple. He thinks the Linux community will shrug off 12 years of User Experience ineptitude and Unix gear-head-itis and start making a good enough desktop to woo even Michael Dell.
    <br /><br />
    The bet is 50$ and the proceeds go to the EFF. 
    <br /><br />
    One year from day: the EFF will be 50$ richer and Dell still won't have shipped linux on a laptop. ;-)
