Java has needed Generics for a long while now and 1.5 will get them according to this <a href="http://developer.java.sun.com/developer/technicalArticles/releases/generics/">article</a> <small>[via <a href="http://justlooking.recursion.org/">just looking</a>]</small>

    Here's a nice little example of what you can do with <a href="http://www.mozillazine.org/articles/article2722.html">XUL</a>. It's useful to note that the Mozilla browser interface is itself written in XUL and Mozilla Themes are commonly written by copying the main Theme, modifying that template's XUL, CSS, JavaScript, and images then repackaging it into a new jar file.

    Also, I read the beta chapter on Servlets from O'reilly's upcoming <a href="http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/javaebp/chapter/index.html">Java Enterprise Best Practices</a>. Not too bad, even for an Enterprise book.
