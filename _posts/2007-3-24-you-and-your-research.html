title: "You and Your Research"
---
Richard Hamming's talk <a href="http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~robins/YouAndYourResearch.html">'You and Your Research'</a> is something I've been re-reading every year or so for the past few years. He talks about a variety of topics including: choosing to do first-class research, how to manage your bosses, and how to keep being successful once you have done something important. The overarching topics are discipline and hard work.

    I look forward to reading it again next year. I always pull something new out of it.
