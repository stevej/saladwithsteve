I'm spending today trying to finish my E paper.
    <P>
    I also had an idea about a very lightweight content management system that would allow me to easily edit, create, and delete documents using my own editor of choice where document names aren't handed back but a swiss number to change that document is. This would just be for basic HTML and text pages, not arbitrary mulitmedia content. I imagine it in Python exposed via XML-RPC over CGI over SSL. For something that's not used frequently, I can't see using XML-RPC over CGI having any serious performance penalties. I even found a library that already implements XML-RPC over CGI.
    <P>
    I am really hating dial-up life.
