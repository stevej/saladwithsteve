title: Amazon as Political Pulpit

<p>
    Check out the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/review/product/B000FKBCX4/ref=dp_db_cm_cr_acr_txt?_encoding=UTF8&showViewpoints=1">Amazon reviews for Spore</a>, the new Will Wright game. 2,016 of the 2216 reviews gave it 1 star for the heavy-handed DRM. I use Amazon reviews heavily and I've never seen protest brought to the reviews at this scale before. Let's see if people take notice.

    <a href="http://torrentfreak.com/spore-most-pirated-game-ever-thanks-to-drm-080913/">TorrentFreak</a> points out the following:
    <blockquote>DRM doesnâ€™t stop people from pirating a game, on the contrary. It only hurts legitimate customers since the DRM is removed from the pirate version."</blockquote>

    <p>There are lots of philosophical reasons not to buy things with DRM. For me, the practical reason wins out. I'd rather deal with having to store music CDs and not play some potentially awesome games than deal with losing my data due to short-sighted DRM.
