I am, in fact, in Oregon. I arrived at an airport in Washington Monday morning at 6am. A few friends of mine showed up to pick me up. Kudos to them for getting me at such a crazy hour. We wandered around the local mall evading all of the elderly folks who use it as an early-morning exercise track. 
    <br /><br />
    Later that day, we played <a href="http://www.sjgames.com/munchkin/game/">Munchkin</a> at my favorite <a href="http://www.switchboard.com/bin/cgiad.dll?PR=118&amp;BI=116955512&amp;MEM=46&amp;CID=7&amp;T=Hermiston&amp;S=OR&amp;QV=02F6A1210644E13F41303203O01F6BE210644E13F43303203O07F6BF210644E13F4C303203O03F62F3D0644E13F9C303203&amp;QT=BCL">Eastern Oregon pizza parlor</a>. I had heard about this game before; the premise is that if you can get away with cheating, then cheat. So, I cheated like a cheater's cheater. I palmed 10 treasure cards, I snuck crappy cards I didn't want to be stuck with down my jacket sleeve, and even stole 3 levels from the collection of tokens in the middle of the table that everybody could see. I was like a dorky <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0102070/">Hudson Hawk</a>. I lost by a single level at the hand of a better cheater.
    <br /><br />
    After all of that, I finally slept. How did I stay awake so long? I was high on life. And pepperoni. And theiving my friends nearly out of victory.
    <br /><br />
    And now, I've placed my parents firmly in the 21st century; They have DSL, a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/B00006HYKM/qid=1072256128//ref=sr_8_xs_ap_i0_xgl23/103-8110660-3882202?v=glance&amp;s=electronics&amp;n=507846">Netgear 802.11b</a> access point and some <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/B00008XOHI/qid=1072256574/sr=1-1/ref=sr_1_1_etk-electronics/103-8110660-3882202?v=glance&amp;s=electronics&amp;n=172282"> WiFi usb adapters</a>. Sweet.
