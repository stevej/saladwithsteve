Was a pretty good show. I remarked to Stacy that I haven't seen a crowd go so completely ape-shit over a band before. She explained that's the difference between all-ages shows and the 18/21 over shows we usually see, music sophisticates that we are.

    Somebody at the show has a flickr account and I can <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/dennis/11558815/">see our heads</a>.

    I loved the giant W. It wasn't simply a prop, it was practically a member of the band.
