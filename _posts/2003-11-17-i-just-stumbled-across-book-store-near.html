I just stumbled across a book store near Irving and 9th called '<a href="http://www.blackoakbooks.com/">Black Oak Books</a>'. It has the largest mathematics section of any used bookstore I've ever seen outside of <a href="http://powells.com">Powell's Technical Books</a> from my time living in Portland. I stumbled across the following: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0534915728/qid=1069031378/sr=8-1/ref=sr_8_1/104-7148332-9127968?v=glance&n=507846">Design and Analysis of Algorithms</a>, Anthony Hoare's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0131532715/qid=1069031525/sr=8-1/ref=sr_8_1/104-7148332-9127968?v=glance&n=507846">Communicating Sequential Processes</a>, and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0937073067/qid=1069031556/sr=1-1/ref=sr_1_1/104-7148332-9127968?v=glance&s=books">The Semantics of Destructive Lisp</a>. Plus I found replacements for lost books of mine: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0132017997/qid=1069031849/sr=8-1/ref=sr_8_1/104-7148332-9127968?v=glance&n=507846">The Design of the Unix Operating System</a>, and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/020107981X/qid=1069031915/sr=1-1/ref=sr_1_1/104-7148332-9127968?v=glance&s=books">The AWK Programming Language</a>
    <br /><br />
    All were about 60% of their regular price. All are in good condition but not mint. That's perfectly fine because I plan to <strong>read</strong> them, not just look at them. Well, The Design of the Unix Operating System is heavily System V-oriented. Design and Implementation of 4.4BSD is more relevant to my daily life.

    <a href="http://peerfear.org/">Kevin</a>, you never told me about that place!
