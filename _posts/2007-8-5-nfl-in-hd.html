title: "NFL in HD"

<a href="http://www.hdsportsguide.com/nfl.php">HD Sports Guide</a> has the low down on NFL games in HD this year. I only saw Monday Night Football in HD last year and so I'm excited to start seeing local games. DirecTV tries to squeeze nearly $400 out of you to see other teams in HD.

    For those of you 49er's fans not local, here's the 4 games you can expect to see:
    </p>

    <pre>
    8/13/2007  Denver Broncos vs. San Francisco 49ers (Pre)  
    8:00 PM ESPNHD (720p)

    9/10/2007  Arizona Cardinals vs. San Francisco 49ers  
    10:15 PM ESPNHD (720p)

    11/12/2007  San Francisco 49ers vs. Seattle Seahawks  
    8:30 PM ESPNHD (720p)

    12/15/2007  Cincinatti Bengals vs. San Francisco 49ers  
    8:15 PM      NFL Network (1080i)
    </pre>

    If I remember last year, NFL Network HD runs on channel 96. It might be different this year.
