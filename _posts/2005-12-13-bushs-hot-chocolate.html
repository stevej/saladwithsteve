    The first hit for <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=hot+chocolate+recipe&start=0&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8&client=firefox-a&rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official">"hot chocolate recipe"</a> is <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/holiday/recipe.html">the White House recipe</a> and it is quite a cup. More like a molten chocolate bar than the powered stuff we all drank growing up. I "drank" a third of a mug and had to put it away.

    But I placed a popsicle stick in it and expect to eat it as a snack in the morning.

    I don't know if this is a recommendation. It's worth trying. Maybe cut it with some more milk.
