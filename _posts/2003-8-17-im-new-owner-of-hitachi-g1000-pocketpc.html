I'm the new owner of a <a href="http://www.infosyncworld.com/news/n/3882.html">Hitachi G1000 PocketPC camera phone</a>. I'm not sure what to say about it, it's like some gross physical salute to life on the cutting edge.
    <br /><br />
    I agonized for some time, at least an hour, about whether I should get another PocketPC device. I was planning on getting a Zaurus this year but I really don't like carrying a phone and a PDA. Why this phone won me over is that it's an example of good convergence. It's not a blender-slash-calculator or a phone that can do my taxes; It's simply a camera phone that'll let me store addresses, <a href="http://www.chesscentral.com/software/pocket_fritz.htm">play chess</a>, and program in a variety of fun languages: scheme, python, PocketC. Converged exactly as I would, plus 6 ounces for good measure.

    I suppose this means that sometime this week I'll need to follow Shellen's <a href="http://www.shellen.com/jason/archives/2003_07_01_default.asp#105914709776014296">instructions for starting a Blogger moblog.</a>
