    <a href="http://www.google.com/reader/">is live</a>. Awesome job, <a href="http://buzz.blogger.com/2005/10/google-reader-in-wild.html">Wetherell</a>, <a href="http://www.shellen.com/2005/10/our-project-launched.asp">Shellen</a>, and a few other geniuses who don't like the lime light (or if you do like the lime light, let me know!).

    This is another example of Google shipping 20% projects that I keep telling interview candiates about (after scaring them with questions about PSPACE-completeness and balancing AVL trees). I feel fortunate that I was able to see this in the early stages and contribute some feedback (and some code for the original demo long ago. <code>norm.py</code>, I promised you fame, didn't I?).

    But dudes, your BlogThis integration needs some work. I will have to send some patches.
