It's taken me a long time to cozy up to Cocoa programming mostly because I find dealing with Project Builder to be a nuisance. It's not bad as far as IDE's go, but I do tend to eschew any environment that I have a hard time using from a commandline. Squeak is an exception to that rule. 
    <P>
    Regardless, I'm publishing this with a client I wrote in Cocoa in about 20 minutes. No fancy gui until I figure out how to wander my way through the IDE Builder.
