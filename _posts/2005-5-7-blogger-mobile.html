    I'm super excited about <a href="http://go.blogger.com/">Blogger Mobile</a> launching. As far as I know, and I don't want to steal credit here, but I think it's the first blogging tool to do automatic provisioning for user accounts as well as for blogs.

    Anyway, I'm so excited that I finally got on the phone with Sprint and got them to fix my Treo 650, which had the wrong phone number programmed in. So I have a backlog of badly framed and poorly shot pictures to upload. What a treat!

    Let me know if you don't like all of the photos and you'd rather I kept them in a separate blog. stevej at gmail dot com.
