title: "Weighted Slope One in Scala"

<p>
    <a href="http://sieve.net/websvn/filedetails.php?repname=Steve%27s+Happy+Time+Petri+Dish&path=%2Fslope_one%2Ftrunk%2Fsrc%2Fslope_one.scala">Here's</a> a basic procedural version of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slope_One">Weighted Slope One</a> in Scala. It's pretty much a direct port of the <a href="http://serpentine.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2006/12/slope_one.py.txt">Python version</a>. It's about 15 lines longer due to curly braces and Map syntax in Scala not having a few niceties that Python dictionaries have.

    Next I'm going to convert it to take advantage of Scala's powerful functional abilities. I'm going to take a stab to see if it lends itself to being a <tt>map</tt> and <tt>reduce</tt>. If that fails, I will fall back to good 'ol <tt>fold</tt>. The goal will be for those <tt>for-comprehensions</tt> to vanish and reveal an algorithm that's more parallelizable and then to run it on multiple cpus.
