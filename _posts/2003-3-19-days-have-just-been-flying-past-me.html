The days have just been flying past me lately. Work's great, I've moved into my new office with a window view of a tree bunch. Very pleasant.  My body adjusted pretty quickly to the 2 hour morning commute on the Muni/Caltrain double-team. Last week I mowed through a book and this week I'm mowing through a review of number systems. I felt stupid the other week when I couldn't remember how to convert between number systems; it was something I did every single day when I was 15 and now I'm nearly 25 and am so far away from the hardware that when somebody mentions endian-ness, I think Tandoori.

    Comedy Central must've picked up Gerhard Reinke's Wanderlust but it's really buried deep in their schedule. I saw it for the first time last week and it floored me. Scheduled for saturday at 11:30: <em> Eager German tourist Gerhard Reinke tries to tackle the Andes, but is taken hostage by the local Marxist guerillas.</em>.  I'd give you a link but Comedy Central's website is awful and sends me to a page that's basically a fancy 404. ugh. Some of you are too cool to watch tv on saturday night but I'm not. see you then!
