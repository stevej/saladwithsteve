Hmm, the <A href="http://www.antibloggies.com/">anti-bloggies</a> have finally arrived. Now here's an award show I can get behind. I probably am most likely to eat a cheese sandwich, so please feel free to vote for me if so inclined. Also, vote for <a href="http://kode-fu.com/shame/">AccordionGuy</a>, he definitely has the best hetero blog. Not to sow any confusion, my blog is hetero as well (yet still gay-positive somehow) but he has pictures of hot chicks and Knight Rider. err.. hot chicks != gary coleman. 
    <P>
    Joey suggests that people vote him Blog of the Millenium. I obliged.  Now go, my army of salad-powered slaves and conquer the anti-bloggies.
