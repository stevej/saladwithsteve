Bowling!! Stacy and I bowled today at Yerba Buena Gardens and did pretty well for not owning our own shoes. We each managed a few strikes and a few gutterballs to match.
    <P>
    I also put some new fans on my desktop CPUs, the old ones I had were so loud that I think I was going
    deaf. Seriously, my ears would ring some nights after too many hours coding and I had to turn the beast off while watching movies. Now I can barely tell the machine is in the same room.
    <P>
    BART police were in jackbooted thug mode. I saw a few harrassments and an arrest. 
    <P>
    In non-facism related news, I bought a swanky pair of nearly new leather italian shoes for 25$ at a local 
    thrift store. They don't look like the pair shown here.<p>
