title: "(How to write a 163-line program to compute 1+1)"
---
Fun reading for last night: <a href="http://perl.plover.com/yak/lambda/">(How to write a 163-line program to compute 1+1)</a>. I disagree with some of his premises, as Perl has so many more side-effects than a clean LC should allow (I mean, just calling a function shifts internal state around much more than is obvious), but whatever, it was enjoyable.  <small>(I'm working hard to not end up like Wally in Dilbert: <em>"Of all life's pleasures, I like nitpicking the best"</em>)</small>
