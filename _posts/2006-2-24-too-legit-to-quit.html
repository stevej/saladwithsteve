title: "Too Legit To Quit"

<blockquote><a href="http://mchammer.blogspot.com/">"One "goes dumb" because he can escape the reality of feeling abandoned and left out from a society that isn't addressing his pain and frustration. The lack of hope, opportunity and employment eats at a man's conscience and psyche like maggots on the dead. My value and contribution to family and community is found in my ability to provide for my family and support the community with resources. I escape the pressures of this reality momentarily in my dance. In the dance I let go and I'm free."</a> -MC Hammer's new blog</blockquote>
