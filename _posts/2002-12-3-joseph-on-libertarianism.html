title: Joseph on Libertarianism

Joseph <a href="http://goatee.net/2002/12#_02mo">on</a> about Libertarianism: <em>Beware of beautiful philosophies of principal that are selectively cited in practice</em>. 
    <br /><br />
    I'm not sure how Joseph stands on the subject, although he gets very close to stating his opinion, but I firmly believe that the <a href="http://www.web.net/~ondy/ondy/socfre/issue2/sager2.html">Free Market Fantasy</a> is one of the most dangerous concepts in play currently and the amount of airtime that this painful double-standard gets in Libertarian circles is the main reason I'm not one any longer.
