So I've been the victim of thinking that the traditional writing process offered me something. This month was an experiment in rigorous self-editing. What a failure! How many posts have you seen this month? Until today's flood of half-edited backed up posts, none. fuck editing. All the fun stuff happens when people misconstrue my typically innocent comments into something truly nasty.

    I look forward to your hate mail.
