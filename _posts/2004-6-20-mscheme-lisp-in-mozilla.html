title: MScheme - Lisp in Mozilla.
---
Back in 2002, I wrapped a Javascript Scheme interpreter in XUL and put it up on the web. I've finally gotten around to making an <a href="http://sieve.net/mscheme/">installer for it</a>
    <br /><br />
    It's missing a lot of functionality, and even a menubar, but it works well enough for learning how XUL and XPI packages work.
    <br /><br />
    Clicking on the 'Install MScheme' link will automatically install it under Mozilla. Unzipping it will show you how an XPI installer works.
