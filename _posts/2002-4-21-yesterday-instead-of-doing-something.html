Yesterday, instead of doing something useful, I ported an early version of zooko's eimp (e implementation in C++) to ObjC. I really like Objective-C, I always have, but I'm starting to see how I wouldn't mind actually programming in it full-time instead of just weekend hacks. I really haven't spent enough time with selectors yet so don't hold me to that.. 
    <P>
    I had the strangest idea last night for a templating system written in Javascript. Make the client do the work, those lazy bastards and their spare cpu cycles. Templating@Home. 
    <P>
    Also, a tiny virtual machine written in javascript.
    <P>
    I blame luke gorrie's Jscm (a scheme in javascript) for these horrible ideas.

    It's been beautiful lately, I should really take some pictures of the bay and my new apartment.

    Emerging Fads is coming up fairly quickly, I need to double-check on my pass and book a room. It'd probably serve the best interests of all involved to book a double occupancy. 
    <P>
    Anyway, I'm off to have big sandwiches (bigger than my head, and that breaks one of my rules) with <a href="http://relativity.yi.org">kevin burton</a> near irving and 9th. I'll have my powerbook with me so no doubt he'll try to get me to add some more to Blogger Pro's RSS feed. ;-) Actually, it still needs dc:time.
