How am I doing? Pretty well, I had to look at a calendar to tell that it's Monday. That's progress. 
    <br /><br />
    Stacy and I saw <a href="http://sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2007/04/16/DDGAVP7VV51.DTL">'Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?'</a> last week at the Golden Gate Theatre. If it comes to your town, I suggest you see it. Don't take your girlfriend if you're not sure where you stand since you might be broken up by the end of it. Go straight to a bar afterwards as the play is sure to make you want a drink. Better yet, sneak in some Dewars in your tummy (per Patton Oswalt). There's nothing theatre-goers love more than drunken revelry. Just pretend it's a sing-a-long and after a while, it will be.
    <br /><br />
    Later this week, Stacy and I will be travelling to Rome. I will do my usual cowboy-politics-when-abroad schtick and they will keep feeding me pizza and paninis in the hope that I will shut up about their lovely country.
    <br /><br />
    I will promise to not make an ass of myself. I will also cross my fingers behind my back while making it. Wish me well.
