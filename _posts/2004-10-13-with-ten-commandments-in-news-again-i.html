With the <a href="http://news.google.com/news?num=30&hl=en&ned=us&ie=utf-8&q=Ten-Commandments">Ten Commandments</a> in the news again, I think now's a good time to bring up Christopher Hitchen's <a href="http://slate.msn.com/id/2087621/">article on the subject.</a>
    <blockquote>
    "The next instruction is to honor one's parents: a harmless enough idea, but again unenforceable in law and inapplicable to the many orphans that nature or god sees fit to create. That there should be no itemized utterance enjoining the protection of children seems odd, given that the commandments are addressed in the first instance to adults. But then, the same god frequently urged his followers to exterminate various forgotten enemy tribes down to the last infant, sparing only the virgins, so this may be a case where hand-tying or absolute prohibitions were best avoided."
    </blockquote>
