So, despite all of the vitriol from that last post, I do want to wish everybody happy holidays. I hope you're enjoying your short break from work.

    I'm enjoying myself in Oregon. I've been playing against my Dad in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/B00009WAVL/qid=1072343139/sr=-1/ref=sr__1_etk-vg/103-8110660-3882202?v=glance&amp;s=videogames&amp;n=468642">Tiger Woods PGA Tour 2004</a> and nearly winning! Not bad considering Dad's an actual golfer. He wants to take me to the Golf Course on Friday. That doesn't seem like such a great idea.
