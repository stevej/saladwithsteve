I've just released <a href="http://sieve.net/mscheme/">MScheme</a>, a Scheme interpreter that lives inside of Mozilla. It's based on Luke Gorrie's <a href="http://www.bluetail.com/~luke/jscm/repl.html">Jscm</a>, written in Javascript, with some modifications and a XUL frontend. It'd be pretty interesting to extend the Jscm backend to support accessing of XPCOM objects.
