Dagnabbit, <a href="http://lemonodor.com/">Wiseman</a> scooped me on the Weinreb post:
    <blockquote>
    Daniel Weinreb on Symbolics' decision to buy instead of build the keys for their keyboards:
    <blockquote><tt>
    We made our own monitor electronics, our own laser-printer electronics, we wrote the microcode, we wrote the operating system, and so on, but making our own keys was, finally, below the level of abstraction that demarked our build/buy line. We were really, really crazy, but we were not really, really, really, really crazy.</tt>
