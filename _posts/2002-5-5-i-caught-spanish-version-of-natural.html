I caught the Spanish version of Natural Born Killers on Univision today. Not understanding the dubbed voices, I actually had a chance to pay attention to the sound track that was buried the last umpteen times I watched it in Gringo-speak.The first time I saw it was opening weekend in a theatre that was completely empty except for my pal Rosco and myself. Own our private screening.
