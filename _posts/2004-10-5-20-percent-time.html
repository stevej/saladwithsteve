title: "20 percent time."

<p>
    You know, I don't want to be all mushy but we're really going to miss <a href="http://evhead.com/2004/10/next.asp">having him around, obsolete or not.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
    There's never a replacement for somebody like Ev and he's done such a tremendous job of democratizing our team that nobody will need to. He's always had as much faith in us as we in him and his leaving shows that faith in spades.
    </p>
    <p>
    I'll always be grateful for the trust Ev's placed in me and if, in my life, I accomplish a small percentage of what he has, I'll be glad.
    </p>
    <p>
    My biggest hope for Ev, besides always having a "next big idea", and perpetual happiness, is that he now has enough money to stop using his <a href="http://www.shellen.com/gallery/ev33.jpg">hands as a tissue</a>.
