    One of the big battles of Syndication appears near an end. From the NetNewsWire beta (2.0b10) notes:
    <blockquote>
    RSS parser
    <br /><br />
    It no longer tries to deal with non-well-formed feeds. In real life, a non-well-formed feed is almost always a feed with an unencoded ampersand. NetNewsWire used to work around this problemâ€”but the work-around had a bad side effect: it made the HTML visible in the description pane. Which led to lots of bugs reports and erroneous impressions.
