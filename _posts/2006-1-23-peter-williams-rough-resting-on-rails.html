title: "Peter Williams: Rough RESTing on Rails"

<p>
    I am glad to see other people coming to the same conclusion I did:
    <a href="http://pezra.barelyenough.org/blog/2006/01/rough-resting-on-rails/">"After working with it for several months I have reached conclusion that it is not the paradigm shifting framework I had hoped for. Rather, it is just an incremental, though significant, improvement to the existing paradigm of web application frameworks."</a>
    </p>

    What I like about Rails is how easy it makes exploring database driven applications. But if you're not using something that can be easily fronted by ActiveRecord then you have no real reason to use Rails.

    For all the chortle about domain-specific languages, why not think a little about domain-specific <em>systems</em>? Sometimes a relation is not the best way to organize your data. </p>
