I finally finished reading the Hobbit. That's not too bad, it only took me 16 years from the day I read the first page to the day I read the last.  The calculations total one page every 17 days.  
    <br /><br />
    Huh, I just remembered that the year I started reading it was the year I took, and aced, my first speed reading class. Is that irony? I can never tell. 
    <br /><br />
    It was a really fun book but at 8 I just wasn't ready to think of dwarves and hobbits as heroes.
