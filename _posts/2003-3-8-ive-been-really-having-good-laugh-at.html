I've been really having a good laugh at Dave Winer's expense. I'd been watching him shamelessly suck up to Google for the past 4 months only to predict exactly what would happen once the Pyra acquisition was announced. I concluded that he'd act like a baby, kick his feet, scream a little, say he's been personally injured, and then immediately start sucking up to our "competitors" (I use the term loosely since we're all pretty friendly) while posting inane articles lambasting Google. The guy's more transparent than a bottle of Evian. 
    <br /><br />
    Of the recent Google backlash blog entries that I've seen; almost all of them seem to fall into a few categories full of logical fallcies:
    <ul>
    <li>They cite Dave Winer as somebody who doesn't like Google anymore and therefore it makes sense for you to not like Google. The logical fallacy here is:
    <a href="http://www.nizkor.org/features/fallacies/appeal-to-authority.html">http://www.nizkor.org/features/fallacies/appeal-to-authority.html</a></li>
    <li>
    They say that others have an oogie feeling and therefore Google must be bad. The logical fallacy here is:
    <a href="http://www.nizkor.org/features/fallacies/appeal-to-fear.html">http://www.nizkor.org/features/fallacies/appeal-to-fear.html</a></li>
    <li>
    They say that Google must fully disclose all of it's practices or else it is actively engaged in wrongdoing. Multiple fallacies here:
    <a href="http://www.nizkor.org/features/fallacies/burden-of-proof.html">http://www.nizkor.org/features/fallacies/burden-of-proof.html</a> and
    <a href="http://www.nizkor.org/features/fallacies/questionable-cause.html">http://www.nizkor.org/features/fallacies/questionable-cause.html</a> <br /></li>
    <li>
    My favorite ones are those that cite the combination of above "arguments" to "prove" that Google must be out to hurt you. The obvious logical fallacy here is:
    <a href="http://www.nizkor.org/features/fallacies/composition.html">http://www.nizkor.org/features/fallacies/composition.html</a></li>
    </ul>
    <br />
    I do like the entries that ask for clarification and plan to keep the pressure on. That makes sense to me.
