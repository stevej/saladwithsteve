title: "Google Reader's Birth!"
---
Wetherell is determined to start a low-tech folklore-a-like about Google Reader. He drug me into the mix in <a href="http://www.massless.org/?archive=2007/05/about-google-readers-birth-part-1">Chapter 1</a>. I would like to clairfy a few points:

    <h3>I didn't say he sucked.</h3>
    Chris does not suck. He said to me: "I have this framework for parsing atom feeds in javascript but I want it do more so I'm going to start parsing RSS in it." 
    <br /><br />
    I reeled at the thought of parsing 9 incompatible versions of RSS some of which were so badly generated by tools of the day that XML parsers threw up when they ran across them. "Are you freaking nuts?" I asked him.
    <br /><br />
    It took me about two seconds to tell Chris: "Let me just make a tool that gives you everything as Atom."

    <h3>I think I did make him watch me write it.</h3>
    I can't remember why. It wasn't more than 20 lines of Python. I had already done the bulk of the work a few weekends earlier, I had written <a href="http://atomfeed.sf.net/">atomfeed.py</a> which generates atom 0.3 feeds so I slapped that together with Mark Pilgrim's <a href="http://feedparser.org/">Universal Feed Parser</a>, made it a CGI, did the dirtiest thing possible and put it on the company intranet webserver. I later made a fancy scalable version in a  fancy proprietary google webserver (thanks to greg stein) but that CGI ran the prototype for the first 100 in-house demo users, I think.

    <h3>I didn't make Chris dance the jig.</h3>
    Sometimes I'll do a little dance when something goes right. Everybody should dance! Chris agrees!
