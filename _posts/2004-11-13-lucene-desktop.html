title: Lucene Desktop

<a href="http://www.peerfear.org/rss/permalink/2004/10/28/LotsOfInterestInLuceneDesktop/">Kevin's  trying to put together an opensource Lucene-based competitor to all of the proprietary Desktop search engines showing up.</a>
    <br /><br />
    Aside: Lucene is super neat but if I wanted to run Java on my desktop, I'd just write a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fork_bomb">fork bomb</a> and be done with it. Ahem. PyLucene might make a better choice since it's compiled natively. 
    <br /><br />
    All of this sort of misses the main selling point of desktop search, which I think even Google has missed; it's not the index, it's the integration. <a href="http://nat.org/dashboard/">Dashboard</a> hit this nail right on the head, but it had a lot of influence in convincing other Gnome apps to conform to it's interface.
    <br /><br />
    You know what would be neat? If Dashboard could tell me about relevant stuff no matter where I was logged in from. If I could tunnel data through IM to my Dashboard installation then it would know what I was working on, writing, reading, listening to, etc, and give me recommendations and relevant recent data no matter where I'm at.
    <br /><br />
    Wait... the data doesn't have to hosted on my personal computer. This would make a great service if you could make people feel at ease with this vast amount of personal knowledge being churned by somebody else's computer.
