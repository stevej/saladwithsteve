I'm listening to some James Brown at the Ev Palace while working on some various issues. I've discovered I can only do one funky sound: "huh!" <small>(that, of course, is my lame white-boy interpretation).</small>
    <br /><br />
    Maybe I can squeeze out a OW!
    <br /><br />
    <b>Update:</b> The "OW!" didn't quite happen.
