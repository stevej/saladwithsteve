Padl's implementation of <a href="http://www.padl.com/Research/XMLRPCObjC.html">xml-rpc in Objective C</a>. They say they haven't released it yet. The last objc library I tried use to deal with xml-rpc had all sorts of problems building. 
    <P>
    My RSS feed should be a lot cleaner to those of you out there that care. Please let me know if you have any troubles. Thanks to Morbus and AaronSw for help.
    <P>
    <b>Update:</b> That first Objective-C xml-rpc library that I had trouble building cleanly built from cvs and I'm successfully using it to publish this blog entry.
    <P>
    I'd still really like to see the Padl implementation.
