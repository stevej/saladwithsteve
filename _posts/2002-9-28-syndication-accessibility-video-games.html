One thing that's been sporadically popping up in my mind for the past few weeks is that syndication (RSS, et al) could be a real boon to helping the disabled, or just those of us who hate ugly websites, view content. One problem is that some sites only syndicate teasers, and some sites don't syndicate useful content like href's and paragraph delimeters. Honestly, while I don't necessarily think line-break delimeters are important, I do think that removing paragraph delimeters from content can change the meaning somewhat. And removing hyperlinks <strong>definitely</strong> changes meaning.

    Thanks go out to <a href="http://livingcode.manilasites.com">Dethe Elza</a> for pointing me to <a href="http://pyopengl.sourceforge.net/">PyOpenGL</a>, and specifically to the kitchen-sink Python OS X <a href="http://redivi.com/~bob/">distribution</a> including PyOpenGL and PyGame. Man oh man. I wonder if anybody's working on a <a href="http://www.subspacehq.com/features/whatis.shtml">subspace</a> clone (or just something similar) in PyGame. It doesn't seem like it'd be impossible for a small team or just one talented guy to spit out. Simple planar physics plus a map, explosion, and ship editor. whammo, instant success.

    Also, nothing warms my heart more than knowing our hard work helps make the masterful social commentary at <a href="http://girlsarepretty.com/">girlsarepretty</a> possible. Happy Weblogging Keeps Social Miscreants from Becoming Serial Killers By Providing A Moderately Acceptable (Yet Still Somewhat Disdained by Bosses, Clergymen, and the Elderly) Social Outlet Day!
