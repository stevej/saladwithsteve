Wow, I can't believe that <a href="http://www.boxersoftware.com/">Boxer</a> is still around, it was my preferred text editor to hack assembly in. It had keybindings for every editor known to man at the time, including WordStar. I didn't use WordStar keybindings, I used emacs keybindings but my assembly mentor was a big WordStar on CP/M user.
