title: leaving safari
---
<p>
    After one too many battles with Safari, I'm ditching it for Camino. Ironic, since Camino is the browser Dave Hyatt started and Safari is the browser Hyatt is finishing.
    </p>
    <p>
    A few things:
    </p>
    <p>
    <ol>
    <li>Safari's XMLHttpRequest doesn't allow methods other than GET and POST. </li>
    <li>Safari crashes if you use BlogThis on a valid XHTML page served as application/xhtml+xml.</li>
    <li>Safari crashes when running certain javascript on valid XHTML pages served as application/xhtml+xml.</li>
    <li>Safari crashes if you use more than a single Gmail account for more than an hour.</li>
    <li>Safari crashes too much.</li> 
    <li>Neither Mozilla nor Firefox will open BlogThis! in front of the current browser window.</li>
    </ol>
    </p>
    <p>
    So Camino it is.
    </p>
    <p>
    Before you say anything; I report all crashes. For the Gmail issue, I even made the problem reproducible and ran it through many vicious iterations with Apple's <a href="http://developer.apple.com/tools/performance/">Performance Tools</a> trying to see if there was some systemic failure I could report. It was no use. Of course, if it was open source, I'd be able to track it down much farther if not fix it myself.

    Some of you will remember that I <a href="http://saladwithsteve.com/2002/04/bencode-is-worth-reading-if-youre.html">started using Camino back when it was still Chimera.</a>
