<a href="http://lemonodor.com/">john wiseman</a> did answer my <a href="http://saladwithsteve.com/2002_06_01_archive.html#85209889">question</a> about lisp and web development: 'i have been meaning to say something about the lisp web programming community, but it really just comes down to "take a look at the portable allegroserve mailing list, the lispweb mailing list, and maybe the cl-http mailing list."' excellent. and thanks!

    I didn't actually know if wiseman read my blog or not, I just knew he read fa:osx and sometimes people cut off the /osx/ from the url and visit my blog.
