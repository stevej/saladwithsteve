The hunt for an apartment isn't going so well. I'm really sick of dealing with Property Management Groups. If a landlord doesn't want to pay his due diligence to meet and shake my hand then there's probably a pretty good reason 1/5 of the apartments in that building are vacant.

    Landlords only from now on.

    You'd think it'd be easy to find an apartment with a good job and such high vacancy rates. This seems very strange to me.

    codecon is tomorrow. Zooko needs another laptop to demo on, there's nil chance of Crypto++ working under OS X on this powerbook within 12 hours. Luckily Darius' idel project builds cleanly under OS X, zero sweat.
