Here's a solid discussion regarding <a href="http://www.mail-archive.com/cryptography%40metzdowd.com/msg01276.html">threat models and how protocol designers fail</a> in the face of invalid assumptions. It touches heavily on themes found in Eric Rescorla's paper, <a href="http://www.rtfm.com/TooSecure-usenix.pdf">The Internet is Too Secure Already</a>, which I had the priviledge of recently hearing in person. His talk was refreshingly anti-Fear Peddling. He even made mention of a point too often glossed over; E-commerce is a success not because SSL is so great but because you have limited liability from credit card fraud. <small>[via <a href="http://zooko.com/log.html">zooko</a>]</small>
