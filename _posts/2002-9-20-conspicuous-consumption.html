Sadly, my adaptec quad ethernet EPCI card isn't recognized in my mac but neither does it cause a kernel panic either.
    <br /><br />
    I noticed that the <a href="http://znyx.com/">Zynx</a> offices are just down the hall from us. They also make 4e cards. damn.

    Why exactly, you ask, do I need 6 ethernet interfaces in my desktop? I don't. 10 would be better.
