Ev describes Sunday's first post as being "all-over-the-map". Yeah, I hadn't posted in nearly a week and my brain burst. 
    <P>
    I had a few ideas for new blogs:
    <P>
    The Bullshit Blog: A community moderated blog rating other blogs on how full of crap they are. First on the list is William Shatner's pile o' poo. I'm convinced he doesn't even write it so he gets 5 out of 5 turds. Seeing the William Shatner's Publicist blog makes me wonder if blogs are the next Guerilla Marketing tactic? Let's hope not.
    <P>
    The Bookmark Blog: A sidebar blog (similar to BoingBoing's Guestbar blog) for keeping links that are worthy of sharing but you don't want to spend an entire post talking about. 
    <P>
