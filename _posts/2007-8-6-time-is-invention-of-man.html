title: Time is an invention of man.

<p>
    It's exceedingly unclear to pretty much everyone what I do with my time. This was pointed out by my cousin who just called and signed off with a sincere "Ok, have fun with.... well, whatever it is that you do."
    </p>
    <p>
    Let's take today as an example of what I do with my time.
    <ol>
    <li>Stinky the cat woke me up at 6am meowing about being hungry. As I am apprently elderly, I fell asleep at 10pm last night so it wasn't a big deal.</li>
    <li>I poured over an old wiki and imported the notes to sidenote, an "outboard brain" application for OS X.</li>
    <li>Wrote new notes after being inspired by these existing notes.</li>

    <li>Farted around with <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/">YUI!</a> for a frontend to my <a href="http://liftweb.net/">lift</a> app.</li>

    <li>Started writing a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slope_One">Weighted Slope One</a> algorithm in Scala. I was interrupted by lunch so I put that in OmniFocus' NextAction queue.</li>

    <li>Went to our nephew Kyo's <a href="http://chinesefood.about.com/library/weekly/aa012303a.htm">Red egg and ginger party</a> followed by a trip to Target.</li>
    <li>Played Burnout Revenge for the Xbox 360. I am currently 25% through the game, I should be done by the end of next week.</li>
    <li>Found several sets of instructions for installing Trac on dreamhost. I made a note in OmniFocus.</li>

    <li>Stacy programmed the universal remote we picked up at Target (more on that later)</li>
    <li>Investigated using an in-memory lucene index instead of something like Splunk. Serialized that into sidenote.</li>

    <li>My cousin called and signed off with the above quote.</li>
    <li>I wrote this stupid blog post.</li>
    <li>Will pick up work on the weighted slope one algorithm.</li>
    <li>Stacy and I will decide what's for dinner.</li>
    <li>Feed Stinky and Pudding and then retire for the evening.</li>
    <li>I'll pick one of the 3 books I'm currently reading and work through it.</li>
    <li>Fall asleep in a stupor complaining about something or other.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>
    Most days are a little different. Replace 'red egg and ginger party' with 'exercising' or 'loafing'. Also, I spend too much time using Google Reader, Twitter, and del.icio.us. At least I broke my programming.reddit habit.
