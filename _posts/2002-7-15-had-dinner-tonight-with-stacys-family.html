Had dinner tonight with stacy's family which isn't something I had done before. I had been procrastinating for well over a year and a half now.  Everybody had a good time and I got to meet her brothers and their wives and stacy's neice. We went to South San Francisco (to non-bay areans, this is actually a city, not just a cardinal direction) 
    to a little restaurant. What a different place it is down there, there are hills with no houses! and trees that may not have been planted! Like I had stepped into Medieval Times (the era, not the restaurant)
