Since I'm not making it to ETCON today (geez, don't ask.), I at least can work on my <a href="http://theory.lcs.mit.edu/~rivest/sexp.html">S-Expression</a> library. I think sexp's would serve as a good texty persistence format for this object store I'm working on in ObjC.

    I had been thinking about writing a Blogger-bot using Jabber until I stumbled upon <a href="http://langreiter.com/">somebody</a> who already did <a href="http://www.langreiter.com/space/jabber-blog-it">it</a>. Now if only I could get his vanilla WikiWannaBe to work.
