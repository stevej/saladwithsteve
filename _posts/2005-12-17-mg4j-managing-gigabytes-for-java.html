<a href="http://mg4j.dsi.unimi.it/">MG4J: Managing Gigabytes for Javaâ„¢</a>: "MG4J (Managing Gigabytes for Java) is a free full-text indexing system for large document collections written in Java. As a by-product, it offers several general-purpose optimised classes, including fast & compact mutable strings, bit-level I/O, fast unsychronised buffered streams, (possibly signed) minimal perfect hashing for very large strings collections, etc."
    <br /><br />
    For those that don't know, "Managing Gigabytes" is a great book.
