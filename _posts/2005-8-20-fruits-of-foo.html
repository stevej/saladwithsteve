title: The fruits of FOO
---
<p>
    There's some bitterness around the blogosphere fueled by people who didn't get invited to FOO Camp this year. There's even an alternate camp called <a href="http://barcamp.org/">Bar Camp</a> formed by people upset about either not getting invited back or who weren't invited in the first place <em>(well duh, autocratic structures breed resentment)</em>.
    </p>
    <p>
    That aside, I took a few minutes to dig around the blog posts of past FOO attendees and noticed a theme: Lots of excitement, lots of interesting discussion, and lots of fun but I was left with one question:
    </p>
    <p>
    Where are the fruits of FOO? None of the ideas I've heard about over the past 2 FOO Camps seemed to make it into any products, demos, specs, or code that I've seen. They seemed to fall into a black hole.
    </p>
    <p>
    Are there worthwhile ideas coming out of FOO Camp? Definitely. For example: Greg Stein's idea to use the <code>Vary</code> header to make a backwards-compatible way of dramatically reducing the cost of fetching site feeds for clients smart enough to implement it.
    </p>
    <p>
    So how can the participants of FOO Camp make sure their delightfully cross-pollinated ideas escape this fate? They should figure that out at this year's FOO Camp.
