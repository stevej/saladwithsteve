I left out a few notable people who I got hang out with at codecon: <a href="http://kode-fu.com/shame/">AccordionGuy</a> and <a href="http://boingboing.net">Cory Doctorow</a>. 
    <P>
    Today I picked up <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0066212448/qid=1014109851/sr=8-1/ref=sr_8_67_1/103-1788598-6567851">Wittgenstein's poker</a> and so far have mixed feelings on it as somebody who has some exposure to both Wittgenstein and
    Popper (I had read Wittgenstein's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0061312118/qid=1014111038/sr=5-2/ref=cm_lm_asin/103-1788598-6567851">Blue Book</a> long before I read the Smalltalk Blue Book). 
    <P>
    Yes, I was caught reading <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0425152251/qid=1014110548/sr=8-1/ref=sr_8_67_1/103-1788598-6567851">Sophie's World</a> a while back. I have no shame.
