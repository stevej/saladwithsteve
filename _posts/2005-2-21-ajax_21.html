title: "Ajax"

<p>
    <a href="http://blog.jjg.net/">JJG</a> over at Adaptive Path has a <a
    href="http://www.adaptivepath.com/publications/essays/archives/000385.php">nice
    article on rich clients</a> in their current incarnation of asynchronous JavaScript and XML. He calls this Ajax. It's good and worth reading if you're not
    already familiar. I have one small problem with it:
    </p>
    <p>
    By defining an architectural style as it's building materials and not
    with it's underlying philosophy, it will quickly become obsolete.  In
    fact, it's already obsolete: Google Suggest doesn't use XML for data
    interchange; just JavaScript arrays.  Gmail also doesn't use XML and
    it doesn't use standards-based markup for presentation. Are they no
    longer Ajax applications? Of course they are.
    </p>
    <p>
    What's amazing here isn't that there are rich clients on the web that
    use an asynchronous tier. What's amazing is that they aren't built
    using proprietary technology; they're not Flash, Java, or ActiveX.
    </p>
    <p>
    Because they're not proprietary, we can, as JJG says, use the
    techniques we already know and are well deployed. This is also true
    for scaling Ajax applications; we can use the stuff we already know;
    Etags, Range, If-None-Match, etc.
