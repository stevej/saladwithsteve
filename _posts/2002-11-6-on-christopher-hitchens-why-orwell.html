title: "On Christopher Hitchen's Why Orwell Matters"
---
<blockquote><i><strong>Question</strong>. In Orwell's 1984, do you remember off the top of your head, what land and people the three nations were fighting over?</i></blockquote>
    In my several readings of the book, I don't remember the answer. The presenter of this question states that most students of Orwell miss his Cultural Connections. I'm totally lost. Somebody? Anybody? Don't say Spain.
    <br /><br />
    <strong>Update</strong>:
    <a href="http://no-sword.sieve.net/">Matt</a> remembers clearly: <em>"they were fighting over (bits of) the middle east, africa, india and indonesia"</em>

    An Aside: Orwell had strong feelings about India, he was born there during British rule where his father was a servent of the crown, and himself served in their Indian Imperial Police for a few years, leaving when he realized that he was the "hand of the oppressors". Coincidentally, he hated Ghandi early on, thinking Ghandi to be a puppet of British imperialism. He later recanted and apologized. Orwell had also worked as a broadcaster for the BBC reporting on India.
