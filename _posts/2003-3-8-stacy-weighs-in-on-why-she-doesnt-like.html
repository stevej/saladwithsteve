<a href="http://www.contraversion.com/index.php?p=blogarchive/2003_03_01_archive.php#90421587" title="my girlfriend, she's a fiesty one">Stacy</a> weighs in on why she doesn't like the recent SF protests:
    <blockquote>
    They talk about organizing as if that were an end into itself. Let's talk and communicate and get together with only people that agree with us! Let's fight this international conflict with an intranational conflict! Let's "mobilize" and use the same militant rhetoric and posturing we're opposing!
    </blockquote>
