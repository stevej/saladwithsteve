title: "Oracle buys Sleepycat"
---
<p>
    It's finally official: <a href="http://www.oracle.com/sleepycat/index.html">Oracle bought Sleepycat</a>, makers of Berkeley DB. On the Sleepycat site, they have a small whitepaper about how <a href="http://sleepycat.com/customers/pdfs/cs_google_1005D.pdf">Google uses Berkeley DB</a> for Google Accounts.
    </p>
    <p>
    Back in 2003, I attended a training session on Berkeley DB run by <a href="http://www.bostic.com/keith.html">Keith Bostic</a>. I will have to dig up my notes.

    I have always had a soft spot for Berkeley DB but working with it can be a frustrating experience. When I was first hired at Pyra, I was tasked with building a demo of Blogger that ran in a radically different way than the current Blogger.com does. I built it using Berkeley DB. It was fun but we ended up never releasing it.
