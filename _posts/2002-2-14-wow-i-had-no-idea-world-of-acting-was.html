Wow, I had no idea the world of acting was so full of <a href="http://www.actorsmovingforward.org/">nastiness</a>. Damn that Mike Farrell, I never
    trusted his moustache.

    Today has been full of interesting, heated debate regarding the uid-lamportwritingproofs issue. I don't think we're going to change each other's minds

    Also, I spent the afternoon with my cousin Chris and his wonderful children, one 4 years and one 4 months. Fun!
