title: MOZ2004 invites Mark Miller
---
Mark Miller is an <a href="http://lambda-the-ultimate.org/node/view/37">invited speaker</a> at the MOZ2004 Conference for Mozart/Oz. Very interesting. This probably has nothing to do with the fact that the <a href="http://renoir.info.ucl.ac.be/twiki/bin/view/OZZY/WebHome">Oz-E</a> project was announced two weeks ago. 
    <br /><br />
    On a separate note: look at that uri. node? view? LtU should learn to use their fancy new internet whiz-bang to generate cruft-free URIs.
