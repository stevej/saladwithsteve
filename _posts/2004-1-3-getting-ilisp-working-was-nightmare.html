Getting <a href="http://www.cliki.net/ILISP">ILISP</a> working was <a href="http://cl-cookbook.sourceforge.net/windows.html">a nightmare</a>.
    <br /><br />
    Getting <a href="http://www.common-lisp.net/project/slime/">SLIME</a> working was <a href="http://www.cliki.net/SLIME-HOWTO">a breeze</a>, even though I had to check it out of CVS.

    Sweet.
