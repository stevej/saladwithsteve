title: My awesome cheap pen.
---
<a href="http://www.instructables.com/id/EWAMSPFFCKEP2871N2/?ALLSTEPS">This instructable</a> gives you the writing quality of an expensive mont blanc pen without the pretentiousness. I skipped the step where you trim back the insert and instead simply didn't close the pen all the way. I was worried the pen would wobble but it was just fine.
