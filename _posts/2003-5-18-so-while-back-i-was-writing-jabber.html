So a while back I was writing a Jabber component using the <a href="http://marbles.jabberstudio.org/">Marbles framework</a>. A Jabber component is a way to extend a Jabber server with your own code.  While the idea is great, the way I wanted to extend Jabber isn't yet supported so I decided to dump it for now and just write a quick jabber client.  
    <br /><br />
    I had never seen <a href="http://www.jivesoftware.com/xmpp/smack/">Smack</a> before yesterday and it didn't take me more than a few hours to go from 0 lines of code to a 1.0 distribution.  Both Smack and the <a href="http://www.google.com/apis/">Google API</a> were ridiculously easy to get up and running with. Anyway, here's <a href="http://www.sieve.net/j2g/">Jabber2Google</a>.
    <br /><br />
    There's one potential bug in it that could crop up during heavy use. I'll leave it as an exercise to the reader to see it. Also, my usage of the Google API is undoubtedly slower than it could be. I'll consult the oracles after I get some rest and fix these issues. Have fun!
