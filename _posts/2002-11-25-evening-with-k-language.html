title: "An evening with the K language"
---
<a href="http://www.kuro5hin.org/story/2002/11/14/22741/791">An introduction to the K Language</a>. A few things of note. K is written by the same guy who wrote the A+ financial language for Morgan Stanley. The Kx team also wrote KDB, a super-fast relational db in K. KDB is written with no loops. None, not a <tt>while</tt>, not a <tt>for</tt>, not a <tt>do</tt>. Apparently that's not uncommon of K. 
    <br /><br />
    My opinion on closed languages is to avoid them and I've done that sofar with K, even though I've known about it for a year or so and I was therefore interested to hear the Kx team is apparently open to the idea of releasing K if there's a big enough developer community behind it. It's such an interesting language I can't imagine not programming in it <em>if it were open</em>. Is Kx creating a Catch 22? <small>[via <a href="http://lambda.weblogs.com/">LtU</a>]</small>
