Oh yes. <a href="http://spe.sf.net">Dynapad</a> has seriously made me question whether a Sharp Zaurus will be my next PDA. I've been thinking about
    Smalltalk on a PDA for as long as I've been smalltalking, and Pocket Smalltalk just don't cut it for me. They're using the iPAQ, fyi. It'd be the first time
    I ever willingly bought a MSFT product, DOS 5 not withstanding, but that was through eBay.

    My love-hate relationship with PalmOS turned into hate about 6 months ago, at least, when I tried programming a semi-large class on my Visor using
    Pippy (Python 1.5.2). I nearly smashed the damn thing into the ground. Oh sure, it can play tetris like a bad ass but try coding a lambda expression
    with Graffiti sometime. Extreme Anger Management Required.
