title: "more pci-bus fun."

The strangest thing happened: Before I had a chance to remove the ethernet card from my system, I hear a strange sound coming from the built-in speaker and my video card stops displaying reds. GB ain't much fun without the R. 
    <br /><br />
    So after restarting, I realize that my monitor isn't getting a signal from the video card anymore... panic sets in. Luckily, I only had to put in the original Apple-blessed card and let Open Firmware reset itself (at least, I think that's what happened) to get a signal back. I doesn't look the 8500 was damaged but we'll see. 
    <br /><br />
    One of these days I'll stop messing with my hardware. <small>Maybe one day I'll only have one computer.</small>
