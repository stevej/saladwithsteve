Some people have nothing better to do than <a href="http://daringfireball.net/2002/11/that_finder_thing.html">whine</a> that new things don't act EXACTLY the same as the old things. It's called progress. I don't agree with a single point made here. The new finder seems fine and if I were to change it, it wouldn't
    be back to the classic finder. I hated the classic finder. So many open windows! This goes doubly for the dock. Old Mac OS dweebs hate the dock but I find it perfectly acceptable. I guess I don't expect the world of my UI's. Maybe I'm a bit, as they say, open minded and ready to embrace new things and not prepared to scream "It must act just like DOS 5, the only real operating system!".  If you remember, there were lots of people who said that, and they sounded as ludicrous to me then as these Classic Mac OS stalwarts do now.
