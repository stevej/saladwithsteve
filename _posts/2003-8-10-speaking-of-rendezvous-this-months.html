Speaking of Rendezvous, this month's Linux Journal has the low-down on what's going on with the zeroconf IETF movement for those of us too busy to keep up. Apparently the IETF has jettisoned the idea of using mDNS and DNS-SD, both of which are what Apple has built Rendezvous around and has instead embraced Microsoft's LLMNR, which noone has implemented yet. I find that interesting compared to IETF's old mantra of 'Rough Consensus and Running Code'

    I also learned about <A href="http://www.strangeberry.com/java_rendevous.htm">Jrendezvous</a>, which I hadn't heard of before.
