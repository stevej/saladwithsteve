Last night I ate curried goat for dinner. This morning I saw a business man reading <a href="http://paulgraham.com/">Paul Graham</a>'s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0133708756/qid=1052932329/sr=8-1/ref=sr_8_1/102-6980094-1937746?v=glance&s=books&n=507846">ANSI Common Lisp</a>. And now there's a man outside my window standing in the middle of the lawn sprinklers. It's been a weird 24 hours.
