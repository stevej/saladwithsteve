The Department of Justice has <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/55/33106.html">started subpoenaing journalists under the USA-PATRIOT act</a>, something which used to be illegal and unfathomable. This news comes via The Register because if those subpeonaed were to have announced this former constitutional violation, they'd be thrown in jail. Awesome!! <small>[via <a href="http://faisal.com/archive/2003_09_01_index.html#106487401130159696">faisal</a>]</small>
