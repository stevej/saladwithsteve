title: Paul Boutin on Privacy

<a href="http://www.prweek.com/news/news_story_free.cfm?ID=214337&amp;site=3">From PRWeek</a>: <em>"Boutin: There's certainly no lack of coverage when it comes to privacy. But there's no sense of priority or severity among issues, and poor discernment between real intrusions and hypothetical scenarios. Every new angle anyone comes up with becomes Privacy Panic of the Week and gets the four-alarm treatment. As a result, the [USA PATRIOT] Act gets pushed out of our national discourse by stupid stuff like DidTheyReadIt.com.
