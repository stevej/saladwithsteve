title: "Self-documenting interfaces and having nice tools."

<p>
    I used to prefer dynamic languages (specifically Python, Common Lisp, and Ruby) over Java for my spare-time coding projects. That's changed recently and I've come to realize it's because of generics and the smart for-loop in Java 5.
    </p>
    <p>
    Since Generics arrived in Java, my code has a much cleaner feel to it. Imagine a class for generating Atom feeds. Instead of the Python code:
    </p>
    <p>
    <pre>
    class Feed:
    [...]
    &nbsp;&nbsp;def get_entries():
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;return entries
    </pre>

    In Java, the method signature would tell me everything
    <pre>
    interface Feed {
    &nbsp;&nbsp;Iterable&lt;Entry&gt; getEntries();
    }
    </pre>
    <p>
    Now I know immediately that what I will be getting can be shoved through a smart for-loop and the entries worked over like so:
    </p>
    <pre>
    for (Entry e: getEntries()) {
    &nbsp;&nbsp;doSomething(e);
    }
    </pre>
    <p>
    I had a good idea that the Python code would return a List (because I can see the return statement) but I'd have to run my tests to be sure it worked. With Java 5, I have a better chance at build self-documenting interfaces. I really like that.
    </p>

    I should probably also admit that IntelliJ IDEA has completely changed how I program in Java. I used to code with the following steps: 
    </p>
    <ol>
    <li>make changes</li> 
    <li>compile and wait forever.</li>
    <li>read compiler errors</li>
    <li>fix</li>
    </ol>
    Now it's more like: 
    <ol>
    <li>make changes</li>
    <li>look at the sidebar for red</li>
    <li>see red, go directly to the error</li>
    <li>fix</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
    Same amount of steps but because of incremental compilation it's a small fraction of the former time and I never leave my editor.
    </p>

    I'm sure I'll write some gushing blog posts about IDEA and Java 5 in a few weeks. Papa's got a new bag.
