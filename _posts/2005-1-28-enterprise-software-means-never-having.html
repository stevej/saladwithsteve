title: "Enterprise Software means never having to say you're sorry."
---
When I first moved to SF back in '99, I heard somebody justify their existance in the enterprise business by saying: "In the Gold Rush, the people who sold jeans to the miners made a lot more money than the miners."
    <br /><br />
    That's cute but it misses an important point -- the success of a miner had nothing to do with the skill of the miner! There was either gold or just dirt.
    <br /><br />
    The great thing about enterprise software was that you could burn through 10MM of venture capital, never sell a single copy, close your doors forever, and still not admit that your idea was a failure: market conditions just didn't line up. Poor you.

    Wow, I have some pent-up aggression about this. grr..
