<a href="http://www.artima.com/weblogs/viewpost.jsp?thread=95863">Guido Van Rossum says in 'M2Crypto woes'</a>: "I've yet to see an extension module using SWIG that doesn't make me think it was a mistake to use SWIG instead of manually written wrappers. The extra time paid upfront to create hand-crafted wrappers is gained back hundredfold by time saved debugging the SWIG-generated code later."
