I would update this blog more except I just don't give a shit. Right now I'm spending 12 - 14 hours/day working on Blogger, I'd rather not spend the rest of that time (minus sleep) writing in a blog. As my girlfriend likes to say: "When not programming, steve likes to program" and that's what I'd rather be doing. I'm sure there's a t-shirt slogan in there somewhere.

    Saturday morning will find me flying to Oregon for the first leg of my whirlwind West Coast tour shuttling me to Pendleton, Spokane, Seattle, back to SF, then to Lake Tahoe, then back to SF. I plan to write at least a third of the runtime for a new language I came up with. More on that later.
    <br /><br />
    I will also make enough time to finally finish my beginner tutorial for the E language. I've been trying to finish that for quite a while now.
    <br /><br />
    Of course, more important than that is spending some quality time with my people. 
    <br /><br />
    I feel bad leaving since there's so much work going on but sometimes that's just how it is. I would feel worse if I were just going on vacation but I have many things to attend to.
