title: O'Reilly Network Hacking Books with Safari Web Services
---
Prompted by Paul Bausch's article on <a href="http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/a/network/2004/10/04/safariapi.html">Hacking Safari Web Services</a>, I've gone ahead and put a Safari sidebar on my blog. I wish it were contextual like AdSense, that'd be super useful for my post pages. Mostly I wanted the developer's token, so I can  play with their API.
