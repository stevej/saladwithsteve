<strong>Internationalization:</strong> I received an url to a page that was in Italian. Intrigued, I asked Stacy to translate. She explained that it was a <a href="http://utenti.lycos.it/bettysoleluna/" title="warning, it's porn but pretty work safe">porn site</a> and replied: "Grazie per te, pero' ho un ragazzo piu grande di il tuo uomo giusto. Francesca non ha un lavoro? Stupida studenta..." I asked her to translate the reply. She laughed at me.
    <br /><br />
    The babelfish translation of the reply is almost utter gibberish. Interestingly, the google translation is identical to the babelfish translation.
