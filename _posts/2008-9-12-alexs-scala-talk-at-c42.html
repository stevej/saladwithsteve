title: "Alex's Scala Talk at C4[2]"
---
<a href="http://al3x.net/">al3x</a> gave a <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/al3x/why-scala-presentation/">talk on Scala</a> recently at <a href="http://rentzsch.com/c4/twoOpen/">C4[2]</a> and it hits a lot of the high points as to why we're using Scala at Twitter to build back-end services. I've been programming in Scala seriously for about a year and a half now and it's positively ruined me for plain Java.
