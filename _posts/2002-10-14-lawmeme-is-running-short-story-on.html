Lawmeme is running a short <a href="http://research.yale.edu/lawmeme/modules.php?name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=402">story</a> on Blender, the formerly commercial 3d application that was recently purchased by the new <a href="http://blender3d.org/">Blender Foundation</a> for EUR$100,000. From the blender homepage: "welcome to the .org era".

    I wonder where the board of directors came up with the 100k price tag? Overall, I think this is at least a marginally favorable outcome. It's certainly a lot better than the half-dozen or so products I've seen get permanently buried during my career. I'd like to see a breakdown somewhere of where the money
    goes after a sale like this.

    <b>Update:</b> <a href="http://pobox.com/~dnm/">Dan</a> notes that they paid 100k EUR, not 100k USD. He also gave me the exact USD price 100k EUR would be in USD: $98,748.00. I hear Dan plays a mean game of Trivial Pursuit.</small>
