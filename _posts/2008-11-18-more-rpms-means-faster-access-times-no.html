<p>
    When I upgraded my home laptop from a 2-year old MacBook Pro to one of the newly released unibody models, I decided to upgrade from a 5400 RPM drive to a 7200 RPM drive. I ran some <a href="http://code.google.com/p/bonnie-64/">bonnie-64</a> benchmarks and noticed a 40% improvement in random seeks/sec and some other impressive numbers. It's helped make my weekend hacking much more pleasant.

    Here are the old numbers:

    and the new numbers:

    </p>
    <p>
    <strong>Bottom line: Recommended</strong>
