Sweet. The enterprise division just released a <a href="http://www.google.com/enterprise/mini/">miniature version</a> of the Google Search Appliance. Funny, you can actually buy it from the <a href="http://www.googlestore.com/appliance/GO0123.asp">Google Store</a>.
    <br /><br />
    I can't explain my unnatural fascination with the search applicance.
    <br /><br />
    Speaking of the Google store, I just noticed that we sell a <a href="http://googlestore.com/product.asp?catid=4&code=GO0116">wifi hotspot finder</a>, too.
