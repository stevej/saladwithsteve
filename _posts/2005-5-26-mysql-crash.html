title: "MySQL crash."
---
I was messing around with MySQL (4.1.12 Debug on OS X), playing with Python's MySQLdb and also Ruby on Rails when MySQL caught a signal 10 and took a fantastically nasty nose dive.
    <br /><br />
    Poking around various tools, I was unable to initiate any kind of recovery as the database couldn't even get to any of it's checkpoints. The recovery tools literally mocked me with messages of <tt>"You forgot to give the arguments! Please see bin/mysqlcheck --help"</tt> as I tried to divine the right set of switches. Thanks guys.
    <br /><br />
    Digging through some mailing lists, this sentence caught my attention:
    <br /><br />
    <blockquote>
    There is little hope of recovering your tables. You should resort to a backup and upgrade to 4.0.13.
    </blockquote>This doesn't make me eager to stick gigabytes of data into it. I think I'll switch back to Postgres for now. There's been a Postgres database running non-stop in my closet for the past 3 years.
