title: "Simulating Byzantine failure with SIGSTOP"
---
<p>
    If your service relies on connecting to an internal network server and
    that server isn't accepting connections, your client will obviously throw an
    error. This happens often enough that you probably already check for this and do the right thing in your various projects. But what if the server is accepting connections but never
    returning any data? This failure case is rare but very deadly.  Chet
    mentioned that you could simulate this using <tt>SIGSTOP</tt> so I
    decided to whip up an experiment with <tt>memcached</tt> as my victim.

    stevej@t42p:~$ ps auxww |grep memcache
    stevej    3451  0.0  0.0   2928  1872 pts/0    T    01:21   0:00 memcached -vv -p 11211
    stevej@t42p:~$ kill -stop 3451

    In another terminal:

    <p>
    <pre>
    stevej@t42p:~$ irb
    irb(main):001:0&gt; require 'rubygems'
    =&gt; true
    irb(main):002:0&gt; require 'memcache'
    =&gt; true
    irb(main):003:0&gt; CACHE = MemCache.new "localhost:11211"
    =&gt; &lt;MemCache: 1 servers, 1 buckets, ns: nil, ro: false&gt;
    irb(main):004:0&gt; CACHE.get("foo")
    </pre>
    </p>

    The client library happily hung for several hours while I did other
    things. How can a process that's suspended not timeout incoming
    connections?  Well, it's the kernel that services network requests and
    the process itself is only reading the buffers. If you want proof,
    look at this tcpdump output. Remember, the process has already been
    suspended by the time I ran tcpdump here.

    So a connect timeout wouldn't help here, you need a recv timeout or
    something else. Restarting your client process won't help at all,
    it'll simply get stuck in the same place. In Ruby, the easiest thing
    to do is to use the Timeout module. Sadly, it only has second
    granularity but that's a lot better than hanging for several
    hours. You can also set use Socket#setsockopt with a recv timeout if
    you need finer grained timeout resolution.

    Do you want to guess what happened when I sent <tt>SIGCONT</tt> to memcache? My client processes, even the ones that had been hanging for hours, immediately returned with the expected data.
    </p>
    <p>
    The obvious thing to do is to write a new MemCache subclass decorating
    all the calls to <tt>get</tt>, <tt>put</tt>, <tt>get_multi</tt>, etc
    with safer versions. Don't naively trust that the expected data made
    it to the cache.
