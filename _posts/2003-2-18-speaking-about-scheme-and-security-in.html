Speaking about Scheme and security in same sentence got me off on a tangent where I read most of <a href="http://mumble.net/w7/">W7's</a> <a href="http://mumble.net/w7/src/">source</a> via my web browser. I read a lot of source via my browser, I've noticed. <a href="http://viewcvs.sourceforge.net/">ViewCVS</a> makes that more convenient since you can make use of <tt>enscript</tt> scripts to colorize syntax.

    I wish I could do that from inside of Mozilla in a similar way you can apply style sheets to XHTML and XML documents.
