Stacy's definitely invited to Pontificon:
    <blockquote><i>
    <b>Stupid Mongolians...</b> More morning commute thoughts: so, is it really beneficial to have Asians represented in mass media as having perfect diction and pronunciation? Isn't it more accurate to have articulate, intelligent characters that have an accent, as do a good portion of the working middle class has? Is the City Wok guy on South Park the most forward Asian-American representation on TV today?!
