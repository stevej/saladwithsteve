This is apropos to my rant the other day about not writing in my blog:
    <blockquote>
    "I don't want to write about climbing; I don't want talk about it; I don't want to photograph it; I don't want to think about it; all I want to do is do it." -Chuck Pratt <small>&lt;via <a href="http://www.braithwaite-lee.com/#HavingFun">reginald brainwaite-lee</a>&gt;</small>
