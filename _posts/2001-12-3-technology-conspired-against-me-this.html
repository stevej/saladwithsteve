Technology conspired against me this weekend: First my imap-ssl server refuses to talk to Entourage for MacOS 9 and since I want to move to Entourage/X this is greatly disappointing. Also, my DSL has been out today (again). The techs were convinced that it was my modem but just a few hours ago my network connection magically came alive again. Now I have to cancel this Covad support person scheduled to arrive at 8am tomorrow and I can't email this to support because support no longer accepts email. hilarity ensues.
    <P>
    Eudora is really pissing me off. Ctrl-E instinctively takes me to the end of the sentence from my years hacking in Emacs but it means 'immediate send' in Eudora-speak.

    I really wanted to get more coding done this weekend. guh..
    <P>
    In less whiny news, the <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/arcll1.html">Arc project</a> looks rather interesting. My resurgance of interest in Lisp/Scheme has been brought about by <a href="http://www.lispme.de/lispme/">LispMe 3.0</a>. Plus I've been hacking in <a href="http://www.endeavors.com/pippy/">Python on my Visor</a> lately. It doesn't seem to like
    all the functional constructs I'm used to in Python. If you've never hacked Python using functional idioms then you really should. it's fun.
    <P>
    speaking of which, please note the <a href="http://developer.sharpsec.com/">Sharp SL-5000</a>. Linux, Embedded QT, Java, Compact Flash.. I want one.
