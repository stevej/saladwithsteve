Matz gave an <a href="http://www.rubyist.net/~matz/slides/oscon2003/index.html">interesting talk</a> at OSCON recently. He's designed Ruby to help us think more clearly about programmig. Ruby's <a href="http://www.math.umd.edu/~dcarrera/ruby/0.3/chp_03/iterators.html">iterators</a> have definitely changed my opinion of using loops. Doesn't letting a structure tell you when it's out of elements make more sense than looping over it's size? I think so.
