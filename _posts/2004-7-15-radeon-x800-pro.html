<a href="http://www.sapphiretech.com/vga/x800-pro.asp">"The RADEON&trade; X800 PRO must be connected to the computer's power supply to meet its performance and high-speed memory requirements."</a> A video card that one guy <a href="http://www.loonyboi.com/blog/archives/000619.php">picked up</a> to play Doom 3. It has 256M of GDDR3 RAM and supports AGP 8x. Any video card with a "lite" version you know has to be expensive.
