I look really goofy in <A href="http://www.shellen.com/jason/archives/2003_01_01_default.asp#90161183">that</a> picture. One goofy-lookin' motherfucker, that's what they'll say about me after I'm famous. OGLMF.
    <br /><br />
    I realize what it is, of course, that makes me OGLMF besides the fact that my eyes are closed and my arms are hanging there like salamis. They're the overage kids at DisneyLand whose parents are making them pose for a picture and I'm the 12 year old who really, completely, digs Disney-freaking-Land. 
    <br /><br />
    At least Jason found The Pose.
