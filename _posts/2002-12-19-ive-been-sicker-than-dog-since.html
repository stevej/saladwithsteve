I've been sicker than a dog since the Packers/49ers game Sunday where we were rained on for 3 quarters and half-time. Tomorrow I fly off to cold, cold Oregon. Hopefully this will clear up in a few days. I turned the <a href="http://books.mozdev.org/">Mozilla book</a> on mozdev.org</a> into PDF's for some XUL hackery while in Oregon. I also want to get a little work finished on my Blogger API 2.0 client in Cocoa. I came up with a whole new way of thinking about it.
