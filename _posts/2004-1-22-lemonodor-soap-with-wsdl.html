title: lemonodor SOAP with WSDL

<a href="http://lemonodor.com/archives/000686.html">lemondeal says:</a>: <em>I just noticed that Franz has a new <a href="http://www.franz.com/support/tech_corner/index.lhtml#soap120203">pre-release version</a> of their <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/SOAP/">SOAP</a> support for ACL customers that includes <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/wsdl">WSDL</a>.</em>
    <br /><br />
    I only have one small problem with their SOAP support: The WS-I group declares rpc/encoded deprecated in their <a href="http://www.ws-i.org/Profiles/Basic/2003-08/BasicProfile-1.0a.html">Basic Profile 1.0</a> but it appears that rpc/encoded is all that Allegro CL/SOAP supports (at least, this is my reading of <a href="http://www.franz.com/support/documentation/6.2/doc/soap.htm#wsdl-limitations-1">Section 11.1</a>). I hope they fix that this coming year. I need document/literal support to write an Atom API client.

    Javaworld has a <a href="http://www.javaworld.com/javaworld/jw-10-2003/jw-1003-wsstyles.html">good article that can help bring you up to speed on the subject</a>.
