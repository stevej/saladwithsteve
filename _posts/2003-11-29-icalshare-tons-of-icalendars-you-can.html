<a href="http://www.icalshare.com/">iCalShare</a> - tons of iCalendars you can subscribe to. Apple also has a <a href="http://www.apple.com/ical/library/">mini-library</a> of iCalendars. 
    <br /><br />
    Around the net, I see that there have been several efforts to write Python to iCalendar conversions. Not suprisingly, there's no running code to be found anywhere...

    <a href="http://www.softwarestudio.org/libical/">libical</a> is a C library for parsing iCalendar but I'm more interested in generating iCalendar events.
