I just wrote a note to somebody and realized that it was probably better to put it on my blog. Here's a good, easy to read, article on common misconceptions of Web Services and how to really move Web Services forward. If you've been following <a href="http://intertwingly.net/blog/">Sam Ruby's blog</a>, a lot of this won't be a big surprise.
    <br /><br />
    In fact, the last slide on <a href="http://www.intertwingly.net/slides/2002/devcon/1.html">this presentation</a> sums it up pretty clearly: He wants to <em>"Fundamentally change the way you look at SOAP"</em>.
    <br /><br />
    So far so good. Who's next?
