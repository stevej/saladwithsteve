I find <a href="http://www.aaronsw.com/photos/uk2001/IMG_1119.JPG/view">this</a> picture on <a href="http://aaronsw.com/">AaronSw's</a> site of Tim Berner-Lee's NeXT cube strangely inspiring. The fact that's it's nearly the clone of a machine I had in my bedroom just two years ago is somewhat odd. In fact, you can still find a cube on ebay.

    Stacy has some constructive criticism about the camera shot: Holding the camera from the bottom instead of the side makes for a steadier picture. Still, a very cool picture.
