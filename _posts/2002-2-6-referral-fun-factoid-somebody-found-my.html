Referral fun factoid: Somebody found my blog by searching for "holy fucking jesus i can't find jack shit". This is relieving 'cuz holy fucking jesus, I can't find jack shit either.
    <P>
    I've been reading <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0387942939/qid=1012960647/sr=2-1/ref=sr_2_11_1/002-5111896-6445648">this</a> graduate textbook in Number Theory and Cryptography, and it's surprisingly readable. Cannon wants to start a reading list for some of these
    crypto books to help build some more levels for his homegrown crypto challenge, this is a good one to throw in the mix. I should start populating my wiki with my notes from re-reading my crypto books. It might be useful to other people and perhaps will answer some of my questions. Oh yes, Handbook of Applied Crypto is now  <a href="http://www.cacr.math.uwaterloo.ca/hac/">downloadable</a> in PDF format.
    <P>
    Sometimes my blog is more stream-of-conciousness than I'm sure some of you appreciate. mmmm.. pie.
    <P>
    By the way, the thought of using a big huge string in order to make sure that you're the only hit on a search engine when you search for that string is ridiculous and that namespace deserves to be polluted.  <b>[Steve's Note: I self-censored the "uid-lamportwritingproofs minus the -" string. My critic was right, it's not my place to pee in the pool just beacuse I don't agree wth it. The criticism still stands. wrong. bad. eviluidstring.]</b><P>
    fyi, if you're looking for the papers, here you <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/users/lamport/proofs/proofs.html">are</a>
    <P>
    This whole uid-lamportwritingproofs issue has made me rather irritated. Lamport's a smart
    guy but this is really moving boundaries in a way that is not only unnecessary but excessive. Google will still find his paper if one searches for "Lamport Writing Proofs". I refuse to acknowledge it any other way. Trying to control information flow is like trying to herd cats. C'mon Lamport, give into the emergent properties of the web, don't be a Hypertext Caveman.
