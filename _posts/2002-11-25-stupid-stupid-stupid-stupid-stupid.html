On a note unrelated to Stacy; Do you know what I hate? People who link to stuff by putting the word "link" in the body of their work and linking from that. STOP THAT! Verbs are very, very useful, link from those. Yes, I'm talking about you. <small>(No, I'm not talking about BoingBoing's 'link' at the end of each article, that makes good sense.)</small>
