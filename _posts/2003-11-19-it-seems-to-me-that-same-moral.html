It seems to me that the same "Moral" Minority that's opposed to gay marriage now were opposed to interracial marriage in the 50's and 60's. The 14th Ammendment was used then to declare antimiscegenation laws unconstitutional. Now when <a href="http://www.contraversion.com/">Stacy</a>, who's Asian-American, and I, European-American, plan to get married, nobody can tell us we can't.

    I can't honestly see why gay marriage should be treated any differently by the courts.
