Speaking of Pendleton, look at their hiedous <a href="http://www.pendleton.or.us/">website</a>

    Also, I saw Lord of the Rings wednesday night. Peter Jackson gets it.
    What an amazing movie his first time out with a big budget. I'd be very interested in reading a book about the techniques he developed for such seemless actor/CGI integration. It was really excellent.

    You know, I lived there for 18 years and I had no idea that the city emblem of P-town was a Sheep. A FRIGGIN' SHEEP!

    Using TextArea's to edit is really frustrating. That crappy Pendleton website just crashed NS6.2 and took my entry with it. It reminds of the lame joke where jesus and satan are in an essay contest and after both their computers crash Jesus didn't lose his text. The punchline? Jesus saves.
