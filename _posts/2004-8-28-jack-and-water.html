title: "jack and water"
---
Lately my drink of choice has been <a href="http://www.jackdaniels.com/">Jack</a> and water. It's really enjoyable, a nice smoky flavor and has it's own built-in chaser: more whiskey. But when I order it in a bar, people look at me like I'm an alcoholic. Seriously, I hear things like "Rock 'n Roll!", or a person ordering it for me will feel inclined to explain: "it's not for me".

    You feelin' me?
