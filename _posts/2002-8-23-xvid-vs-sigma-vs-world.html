title: xvid vs. Sigma vs. the world.
---
Yesterday, Sigma was <a href="http://www.xvid.org/">accused</a> of stealing GPL'd code for it's product, and today they're <a href="http://biz.yahoo.com/bw/020822/220286_1.html">opening</a> up the source for the alleged product. This is very interesting, it's the first time I can remember where somebody put thier code under the GPL after violating it. Now, the only thing that disappoints me is that I would like to see how the GPL fares in court, I think the legal scrutiny would provide for some fascinating, as yet undiscovered, insights into copyright.
