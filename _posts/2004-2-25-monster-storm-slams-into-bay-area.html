title: Monster storm slams into Bay Area

<a href="http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2004/02/25/weather1.TMP&type=universal">Monster storm slams into Bay Area</a>. God is smiting us! It's Newsom's fault.

    Probably due to the storm, a tree smashed into my bus shelter sometime early this morning. I should take a photo.
