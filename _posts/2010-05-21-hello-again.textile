h1. {{page.title}}

p. I've changed some things around here.

p. This site is now generated with
"Jekyll":http://github.com/stevej/jekyll

Switching from Blogger wasn't an easy decision but I felt like it was
time to jump start things and make it fun to write and tinker here
again.

Something that didn't make the conversion were all of the old
comments. Jekyll doesn't support comments. I considered porting them
over statically but I had already sat on the conversion for 6 months
and was ready to move on. See, I actually switched back in December
but had never actually updated this version of the site.

People left many wonderful comments. In the future, I'd like to
encourage you to simply email me. My email address is in the 'About
Me' page linked at the top. If you'd like me to post your response,
let me know.

Oh, you can also see a mirror of all my content on the blog's "github
repo":http://github.com/stevej/saladwithsteve
