<em><a href="http://www.common-lisp.net/macho-archives/bese-devel/2004-3/74.html">"Why we use arch"</a></em> Arch is a really good revision control system. I doubt I'd ever move back to a version control system that doesn't have a concept of changelist. That means Subversion or it's older, weaker brother, CVS. I'm being lazy, though, I need to make my arch repositories available via the web.
