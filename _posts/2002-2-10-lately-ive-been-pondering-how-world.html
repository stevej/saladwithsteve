Lately I've been pondering how the world would be different if a global information sharing network had evolved before the concept of a nation-state
    evolved. If everyone had a shared eidantic memory but still retained the total awareness of self. I don't think this is entirely unplausible, unless you believe
    that electricity could only have been invented in a society in the Industrial era or higher.

    So far, I've cornered a few of my friends and we've battled the idea out, Karl Popper-style but I need to wiki-ize it. Some deep insights arose.
