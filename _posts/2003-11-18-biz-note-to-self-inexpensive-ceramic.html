<a href="http://www.bizstone.com/archive/2003_11_01_bizstone_archive.html#%0D%0A106913336103484287">Biz</a>: <em>Note to self: Inexpensive ceramic bowls placed in microwave and set to "baked potato" will violently explode blowing the newly dented door open and sending clay shrapnel careening throughout the kitchen.</em>
    <br /><br />
    Oh no, Biz! Cheaply made ceramics are probably still pourous and held water. When you heated up the bowl, the water expanded and blew up the bowl!

    As a kid, I used to camp and backpack a lot. Once, I put a rock I found in the river on the edge of my campfire. It exploded for the reason I gave above. Scary!
